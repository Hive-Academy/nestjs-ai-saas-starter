# Business Logic Review

Reviews completed tasks to identify dummy data, placeholders, hardcoded method signatures, and other anti-patterns that go against business value. Creates actionable subtasks to address findings.

Please perform a comprehensive business logic evaluation on the recently modified files. Analyze the code for:

## Review Areas

### 1. Dummy Data & Placeholders
Identify any hardcoded dummy values, placeholder text, or mock data that should be replaced with real business logic

### 2. Hardcoded Method Signatures
Find method signatures that are overly specific or hardcoded instead of being flexible and reusable

### 3. Business Value Alignment
Evaluate if the implementation aligns with the intended business value and user requirements

### 4. Technical Debt
Identify shortcuts, TODOs, or temporary solutions that need proper implementation

## Required Actions

For each finding, create specific, actionable subtasks that include:
- Clear description of the issue
- Business impact explanation
- Recommended solution approach
- Priority level (High/Medium/Low)
- Estimated effort required

Document all findings as new actionable subtasks with detailed implementation guidance. Focus on maintaining code quality standards and ensuring the implementation delivers real business value rather than just functional placeholders, and directly generate those subtasks in the appropriate place.
