# Angular & NestJS Code Review

Automatically reviews Angular components and NestJS services and TypeScript files to ensure they follow best practices including extensive TypeScript typing, Single Responsibility Principle, KISS (Keep It Simple and Stupid), and DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) principles.

Review the modified TypeScript files for Angular components, NestJS services, and related TypeScript code. Analyze and provide feedback on:

## Review Criteria

### 1. TypeScript Typing
Ensure comprehensive type definitions, avoid 'any' types, use proper interfaces/types, and leverage TypeScript's type system effectively

### 2. Single Responsibility Principle
Verify each class/function has one clear responsibility and isn't doing too many things

### 3. KISS Principle
Check for unnecessary complexity, overly clever code, or convoluted logic that could be simplified

### 4. DRY Principle
Identify code duplication, repeated patterns that could be abstracted, and opportunities for reusable utilities

### 5. Angular Best Practices
Proper component lifecycle, OnPush change detection where appropriate, reactive patterns with RxJS, proper dependency injection

### 6. NestJS Best Practices
Proper use of decorators, dependency injection, module organization, error handling, and API design

### 7. Code Quality
Naming conventions, code organization, error handling, and maintainability

## Feedback Format

For each issue found, provide:
- Clear explanation of the problem
- Specific code examples showing the issue
- Recommended solution with improved code example
- Explanation of why the change improves code quality

Focus on actionable feedback that will improve code maintainability, readability, and adherence to TypeScript/Angular/NestJS best practices.
