# Security Review Command

**Agent Integration**: This command is executed by the code-reviewer agent as Phase 3 of the systematic triple review protocol.

**Purpose**: Universal security vulnerability assessment that identifies potential security issues across any technology stack and deployment environment.

**Scoring**: This command contributes 25% weight to the overall review decision.

## Phase 1: Security Context Analysis

**Before reviewing security, understand the threat landscape:**

1. **Application Type & Attack Surface**:
   - Web application, API service, desktop app, mobile app, or library
   - Public-facing vs internal/private deployment
   - Authentication requirements and user data handling
   - Integration with external services and data sources

2. **Technology Stack Security Profile**:
   - Language-specific security considerations
   - Framework-specific vulnerability patterns
   - Database and storage security requirements
   - Deployment environment and infrastructure security

## Phase 2: Universal Security Principles

Apply these technology-agnostic security assessments:

### 1. Credential & Secret Management

**Critical security exposures to identify:**
- Hardcoded API keys, passwords, tokens, or certificates
- Database connection strings with embedded credentials
- Cloud service keys and access tokens in source code
- Encryption keys or salts stored in plain text
- Development/test credentials used in production code
- Default passwords or well-known secret values

### 2. Input Validation & Sanitization

**Data integrity and injection prevention:**
- SQL injection vulnerabilities in database queries
- Cross-site scripting (XSS) risks in user input handling
- Command injection through system calls or shell execution
- Path traversal vulnerabilities in file operations
- Deserialization of untrusted data
- Regular expression denial of service (ReDoS) vulnerabilities

### 3. Authentication & Authorization

**Access control security assessment:**
- Authentication bypass opportunities
- Session management vulnerabilities
- Privilege escalation possibilities
- JWT token security (if applicable)
- Password storage and hashing practices
- Multi-factor authentication implementation gaps

### 4. Data Protection & Privacy

**Sensitive information handling:**
- Personal data exposure in logs or error messages
- Sensitive data transmission without encryption
- Improper data storage or caching of sensitive information
- Data leakage through API responses or debugging information
- Inadequate data retention and deletion practices
- Cross-tenant data access in multi-tenant applications

### 5. Network Security & Communications

**Transmission and communication security:**
- Unencrypted communications (HTTP instead of HTTPS)
- Certificate validation bypassing
- Insecure TLS/SSL configuration
- CORS misconfiguration allowing unauthorized origins
- Missing security headers (HSTS, CSP, X-Frame-Options)
- WebSocket security considerations

### 6. Business Logic Security

**Application-specific security flaws:**
- Race condition vulnerabilities in critical operations
- Business rule bypasses through parameter manipulation
- Insufficient rate limiting on sensitive operations
- Time-of-check vs time-of-use vulnerabilities
- State manipulation vulnerabilities
- Logic flaws that could lead to privilege escalation

## Phase 3: Technology-Specific Security Patterns

**Adapt security analysis based on detected technology stack:**

### Web Applications
- **Frontend**: XSS prevention, Content Security Policy, secure cookie handling
- **Backend**: CSRF protection, request validation, secure session management
- **API**: Rate limiting, input validation, response data filtering

### Database Security
- **SQL Databases**: Parameterized queries, least privilege access, encryption at rest
- **NoSQL Databases**: Injection prevention, access control, data validation
- **ORM Security**: Proper query construction, relationship security, mass assignment protection

### Cloud & Container Security
- **AWS/GCP/Azure**: IAM configuration, resource access controls, encryption settings
- **Docker/Kubernetes**: Container security, secrets management, network policies
- **Serverless**: Function permissions, environment variable security, execution context

### Mobile & Desktop Applications
- **Mobile**: Certificate pinning, local data encryption, API security
- **Desktop**: File system permissions, inter-process communication, update security
- **Electron/Web**: Context isolation, CSP implementation, secure IPC

### Language-Specific Security
- **JavaScript/Node.js**: Prototype pollution, dependency vulnerabilities, eval() usage
- **Python**: Pickle/deserialization, SQL injection, code injection
- **Java**: Deserialization vulnerabilities, XXE, path traversal
- **Go**: SQL injection, path traversal, goroutine security
- **Rust**: Unsafe code blocks, memory safety, concurrency issues

- Review authentication and authorization logic
- Check data handling and storage practices
- Evaluate external service integrations

### Step 3: Security Control Assessment
- Verify implementation of required security controls
- Check for security best practices adoption
- Assess defense-in-depth implementation
- Evaluate incident response and logging capabilities
- Review security testing and validation practices

## Critical Vulnerability Categories

### CRITICAL (Immediate Fix Required)

### LOW (Security Hardening)
- Information disclosure in error messages
- Missing security documentation
- Suboptimal cryptographic choices
- Dependency vulnerabilities with low risk
- Security testing coverage gaps

## Scoring Guidelines

**Score Range**: 1-10 (contributes 25% to overall review score)

- **9-10**: Excellent - No critical vulnerabilities, comprehensive security controls implemented
- **8-8.9**: Very Good - Minor security improvements needed, solid security posture
- **7-7.9**: Good - Some security gaps but no critical issues, acceptable for production
- **6-6.9**: Needs Improvement - Several security issues requiring attention
- **5-5.9**: Poor - Multiple security vulnerabilities present, risky for production
- **1-4.9**: Critical - Severe security vulnerabilities, immediate remediation required
