# Orchestrate Development Workflow

Orchestrates the complete Anubis development workflow with strict sequential agent execution, quality gates, and comprehensive validation at each phase.

## Usage

`/orchestrate [task description or TASK_ID]`

Examples:

- `/orchestrate implement WebSocket integration for real-time updates`
- `/orchestrate TASK_CMD_009`
- `/orchestrate continue` (continues last incomplete task)

---

## ‚ö†Ô∏è CRITICAL RULES

### üî¥ TOP PRIORITY RULES (VIOLATIONS = IMMEDIATE FAILURE)

1. **ALWAYS USE AGENTS**: Every user request MUST go through appropriate agent - NO EXCEPTIONS unless user explicitly confirms "quick fix"
2. **NEVER CREATE TYPES**: Search @hive-academy/shared FIRST, document search in progress.md, extend don't duplicate
3. **NO BACKWARD COMPATIBILITY**: Never work on or target backward compatibility unless verbally asked for by the user
4. **NO RE-EXPORTS**: Never re-export a type or service from a library inside another library

### ENFORCEMENT RULES

1. **Type Safety**: NO 'any' types - will fail code review
2. **Import Aliases**: Always use @hive-academy/\* paths
3. **File Limits**: Services < 200 lines, modules < 500 lines
4. **Agent Protocol**: Never skip main thread orchestration
5. **Progress Updates**: Per ‚è∞ Progress Rule (30 minutes)
6. **Quality Gates**: Must pass 10/10 (see full checklist)
7. **Branch Strategy**: Sequential by default (see Git Branch Operations)
8. **Error Context**: Always include relevant debugging info
9. **Testing**: 80% coverage minimum
10. **Type Discovery**: Per Type Search Protocol

## WORKFLOW INITIATION

### Task: $ARGUMENTS

!echo "=== ANUBIS ORCHESTRATOR INITIATED ==="
!echo "Timestamp: $(date '+%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S')"
!git branch --show-current
!git status --short

## Phase 0: Pre-Flight Checks

### Git Operations Guide

### Task Branch Management

#### New Task Branch Creation

```bash
# Ensure clean state
git status --porcelain
git add . && git commit -m "chore: checkpoint before new task"

# Create feature branch
TASK_ID="TASK_[DOMAIN]_[NUMBER]"
git checkout -b feature/${TASK_ID}-description
git push -u origin feature/${TASK_ID}-description
```

#### Continue Existing Task

```bash
git checkout feature/TASK_[ID]-description
git pull origin feature/TASK_[ID]-description --rebase
```

#### Checkpoint Commits (After Subtasks)

```bash
git add .
git commit -m "feat(TASK_[ID]): complete [subtask/component]"
git push origin $(git branch --show-current)
```

#### Task Completion & PR

```bash
# Final commit
git add .
git commit -m "feat(TASK_[ID]): complete all acceptance criteria"
git push origin feature/TASK_[ID]-description

# Create PR
gh pr create \
  --title "feat(TASK_[ID]): [Task Name]" \
  --body "Completes TASK_[ID] with all criteria verified"
```

### Branch Strategy

- Sequential branching: New tasks branch from current, not main
- Document parent branch in task folder
- PR back to parent branch, not always main

### 1. Registry Status Check

!cat task-tracking/registry.md | tail -20
!echo "Incomplete tasks:" && grep -E "üîÑ|‚ö†Ô∏è|‚ùå" task-tracking/registry.md || echo "No incomplete tasks"

### 2. Context Analysis

Analyze the current state:

- Current branch and git status
- Task registry for incomplete work
- Determine if this is a new task or continuation

Based on the request: "$ARGUMENTS"

DECISION POINT:

- If TASK_ID provided ‚Üí Load existing task context
- If "continue" ‚Üí Resume last incomplete task
- Otherwise ‚Üí Create new task with appropriate ID

### 3. Task Setup

Generate or retrieve TASK_ID following naming convention:

- TASK*[DOMAIN]*[NUMBER]
- Domains: CMD (command center), INT (integration), WF (workflow), BUG (fixes), DOC (documentation)

Create task folder structure if new:

```
task-tracking/
  TASK_[ID]/
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ task-description.md
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ implementation-plan.md
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ progress.md
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ code-review.md
    ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ completion-report.md
```

---

## Phase 1: Project Manager

### Context Preparation

First, capture and read the user's original request:

```bash
# Store the original user request for all agents to reference
USER_REQUEST="$ARGUMENTS"
echo "User Request: $USER_REQUEST" > task-tracking/TASK_[ID]/context.md
```

### Agent Invocation

Use the Task tool to invoke the project-manager agent:

**Prompt for Project Manager:**

```
You are the project-manager for TASK_[ID].

## ORIGINAL USER REQUEST
The user has requested: "$ARGUMENTS"

## YOUR RESPONSIBILITIES

1. Analyze the USER'S ACTUAL REQUEST above and create comprehensive task-description.md with:
   - Business value derived from what the user asked for
   - SMART acceptance criteria that validate the user's requirements
   - Risk analysis for the specific features requested
   - Dependencies mentioned or implied by the user
   - Success metrics aligned with user's goals

2. IMPORTANT: Base EVERYTHING on the actual user request above, not generic templates

3. Save your analysis to: task-tracking/TASK_[ID]/task-description.md

4. Analyze complexity and determine next agent:
   - If knowledge gaps exist ‚Üí Route to researcher-expert
   - If requirements clear ‚Üí Route to software-architect

5. Return delegation package with:
   - Next agent selection
   - The user's key requirements to pass forward
   - Specific task for next agent

Remember: Everything must address the user's specific request: "$ARGUMENTS"
```

### Quality Gate 1: Project Manager Validation

After project-manager returns, validate output:

**MANDATORY CHECKS:**

- [ ] task-description.md created and complete
- [ ] Business value clearly articulated
- [ ] Acceptance criteria in BDD format (Given/When/Then)
- [ ] Risk matrix populated with mitigation strategies
- [ ] Dependencies documented
- [ ] Success metrics quantifiable
- [ ] Delegation request clear

**VALIDATION CRITERIA:**

```typescript
interface TaskDescriptionValidation {
  hasBusinessValue: boolean; // Must explain why

  hasRiskAnalysis: boolean; // Must include mitigation
  hasDependencies: boolean; // Must list all deps
  hasMetrics: boolean; // Must be measurable
  hasDelegation: boolean; // Must specify next agent
}
```

If ANY validation fails ‚Üí Request project-manager to revise
If ALL validations pass ‚Üí Parse delegation and proceed

1. **First: Backend Developer**

   - Implement API endpoints, services, database logic
   - Create DTOs and interfaces
   - Set up data flow architecture
   - Document API contracts in progress.md

2. **Then: Frontend Developer**

   - Consume the backend APIs
   - Create UI components and pages
   - Implement state management
   - Connect frontend to backend services

3. **Coordination Notes:**
   - Backend developer must document API contracts clearly
   - Frontend developer reads backend implementation first
   - Both update the same progress.md file
   - Maintain clear handoff documentation
