## Workflow Principles

1. **Trunk-Based Development**: Each task gets its own feature branch
2. **Sequential Agent Execution**: No parallel execution to prevent conflicts
3. **Validation Gates**: Every agent validated by business-analyst
4. **User Focus**: Original request drives all decisions
5. **Value Optimization**: Implementation strategy based on user value and dependencies
6. **Clean Git History**: Proper commits and PR creation
7. **Registry Management**: Single source of truth for all tasks

**Remember**: This is workflow orchestration only. All implementation details live in individual agent definitions.
