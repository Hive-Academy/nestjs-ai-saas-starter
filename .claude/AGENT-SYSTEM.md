## Core Principles

### 1. Spec-Driven Development
- All development follows Kiro's three-phase workflow: Requirements → Design → Implementation
- Agents work from specifications, not ad-hoc instructions
- Every decision is documented in the spec files

### 2. Trunk-Based Development
- All agents commit to main branch frequently (multiple times per day)
- Short-lived feature branches only for code review
- Feature flags for incomplete features
- Main branch always production-ready

### 3. Agent Specialization
- Each agent has deep expertise in specific domains
- Agents collaborate through well-defined interfaces
- Clear handoff protocols between agents

### 4. Continuous Validation
- Automated testing at every stage
- Continuous integration with immediate feedback
- Spec validation against implementation

        - Run CI/CD pipeline
        - Deploy to staging
outputs:

```

## Task Management System

### Task Structure
```typescript
interface KiroTask {
  id: string;
  phase: 'requirements' | 'design' | 'implementation';
  status: 'pending' | 'in-progress' | 'completed' | 'blocked';
  assignedAgent: string;
  spec: {
    requirement?: string;
    design?: string;
    acceptanceCriteria?: string[];
  };
  implementation: {
    branch?: string;
    commits?: string[];
    pullRequest?: string;
  };
  validation: {
    tests?: TestResult[];
    coverage?: number;
    review?: ReviewResult;
  };
}
```

### Task Tracking
Tasks are automatically tracked in `.kiro/specs/*/tasks.md` with real-time updates from agents.

## Trunk-Based Development Workflow

### Branch Strategy
```bash
main (trunk)
├── feat/spec-123-requirement (< 1 day)
├── fix/spec-124-bug (< 4 hours)
└── review/spec-125-design (< 2 hours)
```

### Commit Standards
```bash
# Agents follow conventional commits
spec(requirements): add user story for document processing
spec(design): create workflow architecture for legal platform
impl(chromadb): implement vector search for documents
test(e2e): add legal workflow integration tests
```

### Feature Flags
```typescript
// Agents use feature flags for incomplete features
@FeatureFlag('legal-document-ai')
export class LegalDocumentProcessor {
  // Implementation in progress
}
```

## Agent Communication Protocol

### Inter-Agent Messages
```typescript
interface AgentMessage {
  from: string;
  to: string;
  type: 'handoff' | 'request' | 'response' | 'notification';
  context: {
    specId: string;
    phase: string;
    task: KiroTask;
  };
  payload: any;
}
```

### Handoff Protocol
1. Source agent completes task
2. Updates spec files with results
3. Sends handoff message to next agent
4. Next agent acknowledges and begins work

# 2. Agents automatically:
#    - Analyze requirements
#    - Create design
#    - Implement feature
#    - Run tests
#    - Create PR

# 3. Monitor progress
kiro spec status

# 4. Review and merge
kiro spec approve
```

### Updating Existing Feature
```bash
# 1. Update spec requirements
kiro spec update requirements "Add encryption to chat messages"

# 2. Agents automatically:
#    - Re-analyze requirements
#    - Update design if needed
#    - Modify implementation
#    - Update tests

# 3. Validate changes
kiro spec validate
```

## Best Practices

### For Spec Writing
1. Write clear, testable acceptance criteria
2. Include non-functional requirements
3. Define success metrics
4. Specify integration points

### For Agent Development
1. Keep agents focused on single responsibility
2. Use explicit handoff protocols
3. Log all decisions and actions
4. Validate against specs continuously

### For Code Quality
1. Follow SOLID principles
2. Write comprehensive tests
3. Document design decisions
4. Use feature flags for gradual rollout

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

#### Agent Coordination Issues
- Check agent message logs
- Verify spec file permissions
- Ensure all agents are running

#### Spec Validation Failures
- Review acceptance criteria
- Check implementation against design
- Validate test coverage

#### Trunk-Based Development Issues
- Ensure branches are short-lived
