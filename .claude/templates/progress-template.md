## 🔍 Active Subtask Deep Dive

### Subtask 1.2: Core Implementation

#### 📝 Pre-Implementation Quality Checks
```typescript
// Type Discovery Results
✅ Searched @anubis/shared for existing types
✅ Found reusable types:
   - BaseEntity
   - WebSocketMessage
   - ServiceInterface
✅ New types needed: None (all found in shared)

// Pattern Analysis
✅ Reviewed similar components:
   - libs/[domain]/service.ts (base pattern)
   - libs/[domain]/handler.ts (error pattern)
✅ Identified reusable patterns:
   - Singleton service pattern
   - Error handling with Logger
   - DI using inject()
✅ Base classes to extend: BaseService
```

#### ✅ Implementation Checklist
- [x] Environment setup verified
- [x] Dependencies installed and verified
- [x] Type definitions imported from @anubis/shared
- [x] Core logic implemented (follows patterns)
- [x] Error handling added (try-catch with logging)
- [x] Logging implemented (using Logger service)
- [ ] Unit tests written (in progress)
- [ ] Integration tested
- [ ] Documentation updated
- [ ] Code review ready

#### 🎯 Quality Gate Status (6/10)
```typescript
// MANDATORY - Must be 10/10 before marking complete
✅ No 'any' types (verified: grep returned empty)
✅ All types from @anubis/shared (5 types imported)
✅ SOLID principles applied (single responsibility verified)
✅ DRY - no duplication (shared utilities used)
✅ KISS - simple code (max 25 lines per function)
✅ Error handling complete (all paths covered)
⚠️ Logging implemented (partial - needs debug logs)
❌ Tests passing (coverage: 45% - need 80%)
❌ TypeScript strict mode (2 errors to fix)
❌ Performance validated (pending benchmark)
```

#### 👨‍💻 Step-by-Step Instructions (For Junior Developers)

##### Current Step: Writing Unit Tests
```bash
# 1. Run type discovery (COMPLETED)
✅ grep -r "interface.*Service" libs/shared --include="*.ts"
   Found: ServiceInterface, BaseService

# 2. Implementation (COMPLETED)
✅ Followed pattern from: libs/agent-system/backend/src/services/base.service.ts

# 3. Quality validation (IN PROGRESS)
⚠️ nx lint anubis-studio --fix
   Result: 2 warnings to address

# 4. Test creation (CURRENT STEP)
🔄 nx test anubis-studio --coverage
   Current: 45% - Target: 80%
```

#### 📊 Code Quality Metrics
```typescript
// Automated Metrics (updated on each save)
File Size: 175 lines ✅ (max: 300)
Largest Function: 24 lines ✅ (max: 30)
Max Nesting: 2 levels ✅ (max: 3)
Cyclomatic Complexity: 5 ✅ (max: 10)
Type Imports from Shared: 5 ✅
New Types Created: 0 ✅
'any' Types Used: 0 ✅
```
