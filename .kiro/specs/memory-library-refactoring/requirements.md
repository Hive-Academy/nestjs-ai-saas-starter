# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The current memory library implementation has significant architectural issues including duplicate functionality, inconsistent TypeScript types, and reimplementation of features already available in the existing `nestjs-chromadb` and `nestjs-neo4j` libraries. This refactoring project will eliminate duplication, fix TypeScript errors, and properly integrate with the existing specialized libraries while maintaining backward compatibility for the public memory API.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to use the memory library without duplicate embedding functionality, so that I have a single, consistent embedding service across my application.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN memory operations require embeddings THEN they SHALL use the ChromaDBModule's EmbeddingService
2. WHEN embedding configuration is needed THEN it SHALL be configured through ChromaDBModule options
3. WHEN custom embedding providers are required THEN they SHALL extend ChromaDB's embedding system
4. WHEN the MemoryEmbeddingService is removed THEN all existing memory operations SHALL continue to work
5. WHEN embedding operations are performed THEN they SHALL use the same providers available in ChromaDBModule

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the memory library to use ChromaDBService for all vector operations, so that I don't have duplicate ChromaDB integration code.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN memory storage operations are performed THEN they SHALL use ChromaDBService methods
2. WHEN vector searches are executed THEN they SHALL use ChromaDB's search capabilities
3. WHEN collections need management THEN they SHALL use ChromaDB's CollectionService
4. WHEN the MemoryStorageService is refactored THEN it SHALL delegate to ChromaDBService
5. WHEN ChromaDB errors occur THEN they SHALL be properly wrapped with memory-specific context

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the memory library to use Neo4jService for all graph operations, so that I have consistent Neo4j integration across my application.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN relationship operations are performed THEN they SHALL use Neo4jService methods
2. WHEN graph queries are needed THEN they SHALL use Neo4j's CypherQueryBuilder
3. WHEN transactions are required THEN they SHALL use Neo4j's transaction management
4. WHEN the MemoryRelationshipService is refactored THEN it SHALL delegate to Neo4jService
5. WHEN Neo4j errors occur THEN they SHALL be properly wrapped with memory-specific context

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want consistent TypeScript types throughout the memory library, so that I have type safety and clear interfaces.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN interfaces are defined THEN they SHALL be consistent and not duplicated
2. WHEN services are injected THEN they SHALL use proper TypeScript typing
3. WHEN API responses are returned THEN they SHALL have comprehensive type definitions
4. WHEN external service types are used THEN they SHALL be properly imported and extended
5. WHEN the library is built THEN there SHALL be no TypeScript compilation errors

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer, I want a clean, modern memory library API that leverages the full capabilities of ChromaDB and Neo4j services, so that I can build robust memory-enabled applications.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN memory operations are performed THEN they SHALL use the most appropriate methods from ChromaDB and Neo4j services
2. WHEN module configuration is provided THEN it SHALL directly configure ChromaDB and Neo4j modules
3. WHEN memory operations return results THEN they SHALL provide rich, well-typed response objects
4. WHEN the MemoryFacadeService is implemented THEN it SHALL expose a clean, intuitive API
5. WHEN errors occur THEN they SHALL provide clear, actionable error messages

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a developer, I want proper dependency injection and module configuration, so that the memory library integrates cleanly with NestJS applications.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the MemoryModule is configured THEN it SHALL properly import ChromaDBModule and Neo4jModule
2. WHEN services are injected THEN they SHALL use proper NestJS dependency injection tokens
3. WHEN module options are provided THEN they SHALL be validated and properly typed
4. WHEN the module initializes THEN it SHALL properly configure all dependent services
5. WHEN health checks are performed THEN they SHALL verify connectivity to all underlying services

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a developer, I want comprehensive error handling, so that I can properly handle and debug issues in memory operations.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN ChromaDB operations fail THEN errors SHALL be wrapped with memory-specific context
2. WHEN Neo4j operations fail THEN errors SHALL be wrapped with memory-specific context
3. WHEN embedding operations fail THEN errors SHALL provide clear diagnostic information
4. WHEN configuration is invalid THEN errors SHALL specify exactly what is wrong
5. WHEN operations timeout THEN errors SHALL indicate which underlying service timed out
