## Value Proposition Achievement

**Before (Raw LangGraph)**: 50+ lines of complex setup for basic multi-agent workflow
**After (Our Modules)**: 3 lines of simple API calls for enterprise-ready functionality

```typescript
// Before: Complex LangGraph setup
const graph = new StateGraph(AgentState).addNode('supervisor', supervisorNode).addNode('worker1', worker1Node);
// ... 50+ more lines

// After: Our plug-and-play approach
await multiAgent.setupNetwork('my-network', agents, 'supervisor');
const result = await multiAgent.executeSimpleWorkflow('my-network', 'Process this');
```

This is the **enterprise transformation** that makes LangGraph accessible to all developers.
