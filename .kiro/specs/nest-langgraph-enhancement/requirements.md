## Introduction

This specification addresses the creation of a comprehensive NestJS LangGraph ecosystem through modular libraries that provide enterprise-grade AI agent capabilities. Rather than enhancing the existing single library, we will create a suite of specialized libraries under the `langgraph-modules` domain, each focusing on specific functionality areas.

The modular approach will provide developers with the flexibility to adopt only the features they need while maintaining clean separation of concerns and independent versioning. Each module will be a standalone NestJS library that can be used independently or in combination with others.

## Module Architecture Overview

The enhancement will create the following specialized libraries:

- **`@langgraph-modules/checkpoint`** - State management and persistence
- **`@langgraph-modules/time-travel`** - Workflow replay and debugging
- **`@langgraph-modules/multi-agent`** - Agent coordination and handoffs
- **`@langgraph-modules/functional-api`** - Decorator-based workflow definition
- **`@langgraph-modules/memory`** - Advanced memory management
- **`@langgraph-modules/platform`** - Assistant and thread management
- **`@langgraph-modules/monitoring`** - Observability and metrics
