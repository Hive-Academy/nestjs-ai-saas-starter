# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This specification addresses the enhancement of the existing NestJS LangGraph library to achieve production-ready status with comprehensive feature parity to the official LangGraph framework. The current implementation provides a solid foundation with human-in-the-loop workflows, token streaming, and basic orchestration, but lacks critical enterprise features including persistence, checkpointing, time travel, advanced multi-agent coordination, functional API patterns, and platform integration capabilities.

The enhancement will transform the library from a basic workflow orchestration tool into a comprehensive AI agent platform suitable for enterprise-grade applications, supporting complex multi-agent workflows, persistent state management, and advanced debugging capabilities.
