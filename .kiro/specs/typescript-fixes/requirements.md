# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This project aims to systematically fix 3,000+ TypeScript and ESLint issues across the NestJS AI SaaS Starter monorepo to achieve 100% type safety, strict compilation compliance, and production-ready code quality.

### Requirement 5: LangGraph Module Compliance

**User Story:** As a developer building AI workflows, I want all LangGraph modules to have strict type safety for state management, checkpointing, and agent communication, so that I can create reliable AI agent systems.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN managing workflow state THEN state objects SHALL have proper type definitions and serialization types
2. WHEN using checkpoint functionality THEN checkpoint data SHALL be strictly typed with proper state transformer types
3. WHEN implementing memory systems THEN memory context and storage SHALL use typed interfaces
4. WHEN building multi-agent systems THEN agent communication protocols SHALL be type-safe
5. WHEN using time-travel features THEN snapshot and rollback operations SHALL have proper type definitions

### Requirement 6: Core NestJS LangGraph Integration

**User Story:** As a developer integrating LangGraph with NestJS, I want the core integration library to provide type-safe workflow orchestration and tool registry, so that I can build scalable AI applications with proper dependency injection.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN registering tools THEN tool definitions and parameters SHALL be strictly typed
2. WHEN creating workflows THEN workflow configurations SHALL use proper type definitions
3. WHEN handling streaming operations THEN stream types SHALL be properly defined
4. WHEN using dependency injection THEN all providers SHALL have proper type annotations
5. WHEN configuring modules THEN module options SHALL be validated with typed interfaces

### Requirement 7: Build and Development Process

**User Story:** As a developer working on the monorepo, I want the build and development process to enforce type safety and code quality, so that issues are caught early in the development cycle.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN building any library THEN the build process SHALL complete without TypeScript errors
2. WHEN running linting THEN all libraries SHALL pass ESLint validation without errors
3. WHEN running tests THEN type checking SHALL be enforced during test execution
4. WHEN committing code THEN pre-commit hooks SHALL validate TypeScript compliance
5. WHEN running CI/CD pipelines THEN type safety SHALL be validated at each stage

### Requirement 8: Developer Experience

**User Story:** As a developer consuming these libraries, I want excellent TypeScript IntelliSense support and clear type definitions, so that I can develop efficiently with proper IDE support.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN using IDE autocomplete THEN all exported types SHALL provide proper IntelliSense suggestions
2. WHEN importing library functions THEN parameter types SHALL be clearly visible in IDE tooltips
3. WHEN working with complex types THEN type definitions SHALL include helpful JSDoc comments
4. WHEN debugging type issues THEN error messages SHALL be clear and actionable
5. WHEN exploring library APIs THEN type exports SHALL be properly organized and documented

### Requirement 9: Complete Type Safety Migration

**User Story:** As a developer upgrading to type-safe versions of these libraries, I want complete elimination of unsafe types and clear migration guidance, so that I can build fully type-safe applications with excellent developer experience.
