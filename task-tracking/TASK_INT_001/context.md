User Request: lets start working on this task @STREAMING_INTEGRATION_BLUEPRINT.md

Task ID: TASK_INT_001
Branch: feature/TASK_INT_001-streaming-integration-blueprint
Started: 2025-09-13

## Context

The user has referenced the STREAMING_INTEGRATION_BLUEPRINT.md file which outlines a comprehensive plan to implement a Dependency Injection Adapter Pattern for streaming integration across the langgraph modules ecosystem.

## Blueprint Summary

The blueprint describes implementing a streaming integration solution that:

1. Fixes the current disconnect where backend generates tokens but decorators use console.log instead of connecting to WebSocket
2. Uses a proven DI Adapter Pattern (similar to the checkpoint library)
3. Affects multiple libraries: langgraph-core, langgraph-streaming, langgraph-workflow-engine, langgraph-multi-agent, dev-brand-api
4. Enables optional streaming dependencies with zero boilerplate in consumer applications

## Implementation Overview

The blueprint provides detailed steps for:

- Step 1: Creating shared interfaces in langgraph-core
- Step 2: Implementing concrete adapters in langgraph-streaming
- Step 3: Updating consumer libraries (workflow-engine, multi-agent)
- Step 4: Application wiring in dev-brand-api

This is a major architectural change that will enable real-time streaming across the entire ecosystem.
