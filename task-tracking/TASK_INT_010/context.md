# TASK_INT_010 Context

## User Request

"lets remove the current task we generated earlier and lets make a new one to make sure we do use this adapter pattern and all of our child libraries does support it, because inside our d:\projects\nestjs-ai-saas-starter\libs\nestjs-langgraph\src\lib\adapters i can see checkpoint, multi-agent and memory, where memory is a bit special because it require manual setup from user and not included into our child modules"

## Key Context Points

1. User wants to standardize the adapter pattern across all child libraries
2. Currently have adapters for: checkpoint, multi-agent, memory
3. Memory adapter is special - requires manual setup and is not in child modules
4. Need to ensure all child libraries (checkpoint, hitl, streaming, multi-agent, functional-api, platform, time-travel, monitoring, workflow-engine) support the adapter pattern
5. User prefers the adapter pattern over the complex dynamic module loading system in `child-module-imports.providers.ts`

## Current Architecture Analysis

- Main library: `libs/nestjs-langgraph`
- Adapter pattern: `libs/nestjs-langgraph/src/lib/adapters/`
- Complex dynamic loading: `libs/nestjs-langgraph/src/lib/providers/child-module-imports.providers.ts`
- Child modules: `libs/langgraph-modules/*`

## Goal

Remove/simplify the complex dynamic loading and ensure all child modules work elegantly through the adapter pattern.
