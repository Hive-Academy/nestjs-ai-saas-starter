## ✅ Acceptance Criteria (BDD Format)

```gherkin
Feature: Supervisor Agent with Streaming and HITL
  As an AI application developer
  I want a working supervisor agent pattern
  So that I can build sophisticated multi-agent workflows

  Scenario: AC1 - Supervisor Coordinates Multiple Workers
    Given a supervisor agent is configured with 2+ worker agents
    When I submit a complex task requiring multiple specializations
    Then the supervisor should route subtasks to appropriate workers
    And aggregate results from all workers
    And return a comprehensive response

  Scenario: AC2 - Real-time Token Streaming Works
    Given an agent is generating a response
    When the LLM produces tokens
    Then I should see tokens streaming in real-time
    And the streaming should be visible in console output
    And there should be < 100ms latency per token

  Scenario: AC3 - Human-in-the-Loop Approval Functions  
    Given an agent reaches a critical decision point
    When HITL approval is required
    Then execution should pause and present decision context
    And wait for human approval/rejection
    And continue or abort based on human decision
    And handle timeout scenarios gracefully

  Scenario: AC4 - Complete End-to-End Demonstration
    Given all agent infrastructure is working
    When I run the agent demonstration
    Then I should see supervisor → workers → aggregation → streaming → HITL workflow
    And all components should integrate seamlessly
    And demonstrate real AI agent capabilities

## 🚨 Risk Analysis Matrix

| Risk | Probability | Impact | Mitigation Strategy |
|------|------------|--------|-------------------|
| NestJS-LangGraph integration still broken | High | High | Use working modules directly, bypass broken integrations |
| LangGraph streaming API complexity | Medium | High | Start with simple streaming, add complexity incrementally |
| HITL implementation complexity | Medium | Medium | Use console-based approval first, then enhance |
| Demo app build failures | High | Medium | Create standalone agent demo separate from main app |
| Agent coordination bugs | Medium | High | Implement thorough error handling and fallbacks |
| Time constraints (1 day) | High | High | Focus on core functionality, defer enhancements |

## 🔗 Dependencies & Constraints

### Technical Dependencies
- **Working Modules**: time-travel (✅), checkpoint (✅), workflow-engine (✅), functional-api (✅), core (✅)
- **External Services**: OpenAI API (required for LLM calls)

- **Node.js Streaming**: For real-time token display

### Business Dependencies  
- **Day 3 Foundation**: Time-travel module fully operational (✅ COMPLETE)

## 🎯 Technical Architecture Approach

### Hybrid Infrastructure Strategy
```typescript
// Use working modules directly
import { TimeTravelService } from '@langgraph-modules/time-travel';
import { CheckpointManager } from '@langgraph-modules/checkpoint';  
import { WorkflowEngine } from '@langgraph-modules/workflow-engine';

// Bypass broken NestJS-LangGraph wrapper, use LangGraph directly
import { StateGraph, END } from "@langchain/langgraph";
```

### Agent Architecture Pattern
```typescript
interface SupervisorAgent {
  coordinateWorkers(task: Task): Promise<AgentResponse>;
  routeToWorker(subtask: Subtask): Promise<WorkerResponse>;
  aggregateResults(results: WorkerResponse[]): AgentResponse;
}

interface WorkerAgent {
  processTask(task: Subtask): Promise<WorkerResponse>;
  getCapabilities(): string[];
}
```

### Streaming Implementation
- **Token Stream**: Real-time OpenAI streaming API
- **Output Display**: Console with progressive updates  
- **Backpressure Handling**: Buffer management for fast streams

### HITL Implementation
- **Decision Points**: Configurable trigger conditions
- **Approval Interface**: Console prompts with stdin reading
- **Timeout Handling**: Default approval after 30 seconds
- **Context Display**: Rich decision information formatting

## 🔄 Rollback Strategy

If integration issues prevent completion:

1. **Minimal Viable Demo**: Simple single-agent with streaming
2. **Standalone Implementation**: Separate from main codebase
3. **Mock Services**: Use in-memory implementations
4. **Documentation**: Detailed implementation plan for future completion

## 🚀 Success Definition

**Day 4 is successful if**:
1. Supervisor agent coordinates 2+ workers ✅
2. Real-time streaming works and is visible ✅  
3. HITL approval interrupts and continues workflow ✅
4. Complete demonstration runs without errors ✅
5. Code follows SOLID principles and type safety ✅

**Bonus achievements**:
- Performance monitoring integration
- Time-travel debugging capabilities
- Configuration-driven behavior
- Comprehensive error handling

## 📋 Deliverables

1. **Working Agent Code**: Supervisor + worker implementations
2. **Demonstration Script**: Complete workflow showcase
3. **Configuration Files**: Agent behavior settings
4. **Usage Documentation**: How to run and extend agents
5. **Completion Report**: Metrics, lessons learned, next steps
