- WHEN agents coordinate THEN the multi-agent system demonstrates supervisor patterns, memory integration, real-time streaming, and HITL workflows
- WHEN tools execute THEN GitHub analysis, content creation, and brand strategy capabilities are visible
- WHEN memory systems activate THEN ChromaDB semantic search and Neo4j relationship mapping work together

### Requirement 2: DevBrand Chat Studio Backend Implementation

**User Story**: As the revolutionary frontend interface, I need a sophisticated backend that can support all 5 dimensional interface modes with real-time coordination and intelligent agent workflows.

**Acceptance Criteria**:

- WHEN 3D Agent Constellation is active THEN agents have spatial presence with real-time coordination data
- WHEN Workflow Canvas visualizes THEN D3 receives live workflow state, tool execution, and decision flows
- WHEN Memory Constellation explores THEN ChromaDB + Neo4j data streams create explorable knowledge universe
- WHEN Content Forge creates THEN AI workflows materialize content with HITL approval processes
- WHEN WebSocket connects THEN all interface modes receive real-time agent activity streams

### Requirement 3: Multi-Agent Personal Brand System

**User Story**: As a developer user, I want intelligent agents that analyze my GitHub work and transform it into personal brand content, so that my technical achievements become visible professional content.

**Acceptance Criteria**:

- WHEN GitHub username provided THEN Code Analyzer Agent processes commits, patterns, and achievements
- WHEN analysis completes THEN Content Creator Agent generates LinkedIn posts and Dev.to articles
- WHEN content created THEN Brand Strategist Agent optimizes for personal brand evolution
- WHEN confidence low THEN HITL approval workflows engage with clear risk indicators
- WHEN memory stores data THEN future interactions become increasingly personalized

### Requirement 4: Advanced Memory Integration Showcase

**User Story**: As a technical showcase, I want the memory system to demonstrate hybrid vector + graph intelligence that learns and adapts across sessions.

**Acceptance Criteria**:

- WHEN developer achievements stored THEN ChromaDB enables semantic search of work history
- WHEN relationships mapped THEN Neo4j connects projects, technologies, and skills
- WHEN memory retrieved THEN agents use context to improve content generation
- WHEN brand evolves THEN system tracks strategy changes over time
- WHEN query executed THEN hybrid search combines semantic and graph traversal

## Implementation Scope

**API Endpoints Needed**:

- `/api/chat/stream` - WebSocket for real-time agent communication
- `/api/agents/status` - Current agent states and coordination data
- `/api/memory/context` - Relevant memories for current conversation
- `/api/github/analyze` - GitHub repository analysis triggers
- `/api/content/generate` - Content creation workflows
- `/api/workflow/progress` - Real-time workflow state for visualizations
- `/api/brand/strategy` - Personal brand optimization data

**Package Integration Requirements**:

- **Core Libraries**: @nestjs-chromadb, @nestjs-neo4j, @langgraph-modules/core
- **Specialized Modules**: memory, multi-agent, monitoring, checkpoint, streaming, platform, hitl, workflow-engine, time-travel, functional-api
- **LLM Integration**: 7-provider system already implemented
- **Real-time Communication**: WebSocket + Server-Sent Events

**Timeline Estimate**: 2-3 weeks for comprehensive implementation
**Complexity**: High - requires sophisticated coordination of multiple advanced systems

## Success Metrics

- **Package Integration**: All 14+ packages actively utilized and demonstrated
- **Frontend Compatibility**: Powers all 5 revolutionary interface modes seamlessly
- **Agent Coordination**: Supervisor workflows with visible decision-making processes
- **Memory Intelligence**: Hybrid search demonstrating vector + graph capabilities
- **Real-time Performance**: Sub-second response times for agent switching and tool execution
- **Content Quality**: High-quality LinkedIn/Dev.to content generation with measurable improvements over time

## Dependencies & Constraints

**Technical Dependencies**:

- Existing 14+ packages must integrate without conflicts
- Neo4j, ChromaDB, Redis services must be operational
- 7-provider LLM system already implemented (TASK_LLM_001-006)
- Frontend WebSocket integration requirements from TASK_FE_001

**Integration Constraints**:

- Must maintain type safety across all package boundaries
- Cannot modify existing package APIs - only extend and integrate
- Performance must support real-time 3D visualizations and streaming
- Memory usage must scale for production workloads

**Data Flow Requirements**:

- GitHub API integration for repository analysis
- ChromaDB for semantic search of developer achievements
- Neo4j for relationship mapping between projects/skills/technologies
- Real-time WebSocket streams for all interface modes
- HITL approval workflows with confidence scoring

## Architecture Requirements

**Multi-Agent System**:

- DevBrandSupervisorWorkflow extending existing supervisor patterns
- GitHub Code Analyzer Agent with repository analysis tools
- Content Creator Agent for LinkedIn/Dev.to generation
- Brand Strategist Agent with personalization algorithms
- Real-time agent coordination with visible decision trees

**Memory Architecture**:

- PersonalBrandMemoryService extending existing memory facades
- ChromaDB collections: dev-achievements, content-metrics, brand-history
- Neo4j relationships: Developer → Achievement → Technology → Content
- Hybrid search combining semantic and graph traversal
- Context-aware personalization improving over time

**Streaming Architecture**:

- WebSocket Gateway for real-time agent communication
- Server-Sent Events for workflow progress streaming
- Agent action streaming with tool execution visibility
- Memory retrieval streaming for context display
- Performance metrics streaming for monitoring dashboards

## Next Agent Decision

**Recommendation**: software-architect

**Rationale**: This is a complex integration task requiring sophisticated architectural design to coordinate 14+ packages into a cohesive showcase API. The software-architect has the experience needed to:

1. Design clean integration patterns between multiple advanced packages
2. Create robust multi-agent coordination architectures
3. Implement real-time streaming systems for 5 different interface modes
4. Ensure performance and scalability for production showcase deployment
5. Translate the revolutionary frontend vision into concrete backend implementation

**Key Context for Software-Architect**:

- Frontend already complete with 5 revolutionary interface modes requiring specific data streams
- 14+ packages available and ready for integration (no research needed)
- Multi-agent patterns, memory systems, and streaming infrastructure already exist
- Focus should be on sophisticated integration and showcase-quality implementation
- This is the flagship demonstration of the entire ecosystem's capabilities
