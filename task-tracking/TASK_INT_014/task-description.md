# Requirements Document - TASK_INT_014

## Introduction

The dev-brand-api application is the primary demonstration vehicle for the entire NestJS AI SaaS Starter ecosystem. Currently, it faces critical configuration and serving issues that prevent proper showcasing of all publishable libraries. This task will establish a comprehensive, error-free demo API that demonstrates the full capabilities of all 10 publishable libraries in the monorepo.

**Business Value**: A functional demo API is essential for:

- Developer adoption and library validation
- Documentation completeness and accuracy
- CI/CD pipeline integrity
- Production-ready library verification
- Stakeholder demonstrations and library promotion

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: API Service Health

**User Story:** As a developer evaluating the NestJS AI SaaS Starter, I want the dev-brand-api to serve without errors, so that I can immediately test and validate all library functionalities.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN running `npx nx serve dev-brand-api` THEN the application SHALL start successfully on port 3000
2. WHEN accessing `http://localhost:3000/api/health` THEN the system SHALL return HTTP 200 with health status
3. WHEN build dependencies fail THEN the system SHALL provide clear error messages and resolution guidance
4. WHEN lockfile issues occur THEN the system SHALL handle pruned lockfile generation gracefully

### Requirement 2: Library Integration Demos

**User Story:** As a developer exploring library capabilities, I want comprehensive demo endpoints for each publishable library, so that I can understand implementation patterns and features.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN accessing ChromaDB demo endpoints THEN the system SHALL demonstrate vector operations, semantic search, and document management
2. WHEN accessing Neo4j demo endpoints THEN the system SHALL demonstrate graph operations, relationship queries, and data modeling
3. WHEN accessing LangGraph demo endpoints THEN the system SHALL demonstrate workflow orchestration, streaming, and tool integration
4. WHEN accessing Memory module demos THEN the system SHALL demonstrate contextual memory operations and retention policies
5. WHEN accessing Checkpoint module demos THEN the system SHALL demonstrate state persistence and recovery mechanisms
6. WHEN accessing all 7 LangGraph modules THEN each SHALL have dedicated demo endpoints with clear functionality examples

### Requirement 3: Configuration Correctness

**User Story:** As a library maintainer, I want all library configurations to be properly structured and validated, so that the demo accurately represents production-ready implementations.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN reviewing configuration files THEN all database connections SHALL be properly configured with fallbacks
2. WHEN validating environment variables THEN all required variables SHALL be documented with example values
3. WHEN checking dependency imports THEN all library imports SHALL use proper @hive-academy alias paths
4. WHEN examining service registrations THEN all modules SHALL be properly registered in the NestJS dependency injection system

### Requirement 4: Swagger Documentation

**User Story:** As an API consumer, I want complete Swagger documentation for all demo endpoints, so that I can understand request/response formats and test the API interactively.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN accessing `/docs` THEN the system SHALL display complete Swagger UI with all endpoints documented
2. WHEN viewing endpoint documentation THEN each SHALL include request schemas, response examples, and error handling
3. WHEN testing endpoints through Swagger THEN all operations SHALL execute successfully with proper validation
4. WHEN reviewing API structure THEN endpoints SHALL be logically grouped by library/module for clarity

## Non-Functional Requirements

- **Error Handling**: Graceful degradation when external services (ChromaDB, Neo4j) are unavailable
- **Recovery Time**: Application restart completes within 15 seconds after configuration changes
- **Dependency Management**: Robust handling of library version conflicts and missing dependencies

### Security Requirements

- **API Security**: Input validation for all demo endpoints to prevent injection attacks
- **Database Security**: Secure connection strings with environment variable protection
- **CORS Policy**: Properly configured CORS for development and demo environments
- **Error Disclosure**: No sensitive information exposed in error responses

### Scalability Requirements

- **Concurrent Users**: Handle 50 concurrent demo requests without degradation
- **Library Loading**: Lazy loading of library modules to reduce initial startup time
- **Database Scaling**: Connection pooling strategies for optimal resource utilization

## Risk Analysis

### Technical Risks

- **Risk**: Dependency version conflicts between libraries

  - **Probability**: High
  - **Impact**: Critical
  - **Mitigation**: Implement dependency resolution strategy and version alignment
  - **Contingency**: Create library compatibility matrix and fallback configurations

- **Risk**: Database service dependencies (ChromaDB, Neo4j, Redis) unavailable

  - **Probability**: Medium
  - **Impact**: High
  - **Mitigation**: Docker Compose setup with health checks and fallback mocking
  - **Contingency**: Mock services for demonstration when databases unavailable
