**Acceptance Criteria**:

- WHEN using the interface THEN it supports multiple dimensional modes (3D Spatial, Canvas, Memory, Forge, Chat)
- WHEN switching between modes THEN transitions are smooth and contextually appropriate
- WHEN interacting with agents THEN they have distinct visual personalities and spatial presence
- WHEN viewing workflows THEN agent coordination and data flow are visually represented

### Requirement 3: Real-time Agent Visualization

**User Story**: As a developer using the AI system, I want to see multi-agent coordination in real-time, so that I understand how the system processes my requests and generates personalized content.

**Acceptance Criteria**:

- WHEN agents are active THEN their current state and actions are visually displayed
- WHEN tools are executed THEN the process is shown with progress indicators
- WHEN memory is accessed THEN relevant memories are highlighted in context
- WHEN content is generated THEN the creation process is visualized step-by-step

### Requirement 4: Angular 20 Modern Architecture

**User Story**: As a developer working on this codebase, I want the frontend built with modern Angular 20 patterns and proven libraries, so that the code is maintainable, performant, and showcases current best practices.

**Acceptance Criteria**:

- WHEN building components THEN use standalone components and Angular Signals
- WHEN managing state THEN implement NgRx SignalStore for complex coordination
- WHEN adding 3D features THEN integrate Three.js following the researched patterns
- WHEN implementing animations THEN use GSAP for complex transitions

### From angular-mvp-library-research.md:

- **Proven Libraries**: Three.js, D3.js + Observable Plot, GSAP, Angular Signals + NgRx SignalStore
- **Implementation Strategy**: Phase-based approach with performance optimization
- **Integration Patterns**: Standalone components, signal-based state management, modular imports

## Implementation Scope

**Primary Focus Areas**:

1. **Agent Visualization System** - Real-time display of multi-agent coordination
2. **Multi-Dimensional Interface** - Implement core interface morphing capabilities
3. **Memory Context Display** - Show relevant memories and context in real-time
4. **3D Spatial Interface** - Basic 3D agent constellation view
5. **Modern Angular Architecture** - Signals, standalone components, performance optimization

**Core Components to Build**:

- Agent constellation 3D visualization
- Workflow canvas with D3.js
- Real-time chat interface with agent switching
- Memory context sidebar
- Content preview and approval system
- Multi-dimensional interface controller

**Timeline Estimate**: 8-12 weeks for comprehensive implementation
**Complexity**: High - involves advanced 3D graphics, real-time coordination, and novel UX patterns

## Success Metrics

**User Experience Validation**:

- Users can clearly see which agent is active and what it's doing
- Interface transitions feel natural and enhance rather than distract from workflow
- Memory context provides meaningful assistance to user interactions
- 3D visualizations provide genuine value beyond aesthetic appeal

**Technical Performance**:

- Interface loads and renders smoothly on target devices
- Real-time updates don't cause performance degradation
- Memory usage remains reasonable during extended sessions
- WebSocket connections are stable and responsive

**Vision Alignment**:

- All major concepts from vision documents are represented in the implementation
- The interface showcases the platform's AI capabilities effectively
- Users understand the multi-agent coordination through visual representation
- The system demonstrates the power of the underlying architecture

## Dependencies & Constraints

**Technical Dependencies**:

- Angular 20 framework with latest features
- WebSocket integration with backend agent system
- Three.js for 3D visualization capabilities
- D3.js for workflow and data visualization
- GSAP for complex animations and transitions

**Current Status Constraints**:

- Core API packages are still being finalized (parallel development)
- Must work with existing dev-brand-ui Angular app structure
- Should leverage existing demo libraries where possible
- Performance must be optimized for web delivery

**External Requirements**:
