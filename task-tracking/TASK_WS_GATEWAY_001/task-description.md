# Task Requirements - TASK_WS_GATEWAY_001

## User's Request

**Original Request**: "Create a comprehensive implementation plan for enhancing the @hive-academy/langgraph-streaming library with an integrated WebSocket gateway"

**Core Need**: Integrate WebSocket gateway functionality directly into the existing streaming library while maintaining publishable package standards, TypeScript best practices, architectural boundaries, and backward compatibility.

## Requirements Analysis

### Requirement 1: WebSocket Gateway Integration

**User Story**: As a library consumer, I want WebSocket gateway functionality integrated directly into the @hive-academy/langgraph-streaming library, so that I can deploy real-time streaming capabilities without additional package dependencies.

**Acceptance Criteria**:

- WHEN the library is imported THEN it includes WebSocket gateway classes and decorators
- WHEN configuring the StreamingModule THEN WebSocket gateway options are available
- WHEN clients connect via WebSocket THEN they can subscribe to streaming events
- WHEN backward compatibility is tested THEN existing integrations continue to work unchanged

### Requirement 2: Architectural Boundary Preservation

**User Story**: As a library maintainer, I want clear separation between publishable package code and consumer application code, so that the library remains modular and reusable.

**Acceptance Criteria**:

- WHEN publishing the package THEN only library-specific code is included
- WHEN consumer apps integrate THEN they can customize gateway behavior without modifying library code
- WHEN reviewing code structure THEN clear boundaries exist between core streaming and gateway features
- WHEN testing package boundaries THEN no circular dependencies or leakage occurs

### Requirement 3: Multi-Agent Coordination Implementation

**User Story**: As a development team, I want specialist agents coordinating the implementation, so that each aspect (architecture, TypeScript, testing, etc.) receives expert attention.

**Acceptance Criteria**:

- WHEN agents are assigned THEN each has clear responsibilities and deliverables
- WHEN coordination occurs THEN agents share context and maintain consistency
- WHEN quality gates are checked THEN all specialists validate their domains
- WHEN implementation phases complete THEN handoffs are clean and documented

### Requirement 4: TypeScript Integration Excellence

**User Story**: As a TypeScript developer, I want strict typing and modern patterns throughout the gateway integration, so that the code is maintainable and follows enterprise standards.

**Acceptance Criteria**:

- WHEN TypeScript compilation occurs THEN zero `any` types exist
- WHEN interfaces are defined THEN they follow domain-driven design principles
- WHEN decorators are implemented THEN they provide proper metadata typing
- WHEN validation occurs THEN runtime type checking is comprehensive

### Requirement 5: Testing and Validation Strategy

**User Story**: As a quality assurance specialist, I want comprehensive testing covering unit, integration, and package boundary scenarios, so that the enhancement is production-ready.

**Acceptance Criteria**:

- WHEN unit tests run THEN 80%+ coverage is achieved for new code
- WHEN integration tests execute THEN WebSocket functionality works end-to-end
- WHEN package testing occurs THEN publishable package structure is validated
- WHEN backward compatibility tests run THEN existing functionality remains intact

## Success Metrics

- WebSocket gateway successfully integrated into @hive-academy/langgraph-streaming package
- Package remains publishable with proper exports and dependency management
- All TypeScript compilation passes with strict mode enabled
- Test coverage meets or exceeds 80% for new functionality
- Backward compatibility preserved for existing StreamingModule consumers
- Multi-agent coordination delivers quality implementation across all domains

## Implementation Scope

**Timeline Estimate**: 5-7 days for complete implementation with quality validation
**Complexity**: Complex - Involves package architecture, WebSocket integration, TypeScript patterns, and multi-agent coordination

## Dependencies & Constraints

**Technical Constraints**:

- Must maintain @hive-academy/langgraph-streaming as publishable NPM package
- Must preserve backward compatibility with existing StreamingModule.forRoot() usage
- Must follow NestJS WebSocket gateway patterns and decorators
- Must integrate with existing WebSocketBridgeService without breaking changes

**Dependencies**:

- NestJS WebSocket platform (@nestjs/websockets, @nestjs/platform-socket.io)
- Existing streaming infrastructure (TokenStreamingService, EventStreamProcessorService)
- TypeScript 5.x with strict mode compilation
- Multi-agent coordination module for implementation orchestration

## Next Agent Decision

**Recommendation**: software-architect
**Rationale**: This is a complex architectural enhancement requiring detailed design of package boundaries, WebSocket integration patterns, and TypeScript structure before implementation can begin. The architect needs to define how WebSocket gateway components integrate with existing streaming services while maintaining publishable package standards.
