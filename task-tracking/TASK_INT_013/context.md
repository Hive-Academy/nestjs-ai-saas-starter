# TASK_INT_013 Context

## Original User Request
User Request: "i think we have an issue in our workspace where jest is not configured correctly and inside our libraries also jest is not configured correctly in some of them which makes it hard for us to make a solid testing for our libraries can we systematically fix this first with out tester to make sure all of our nx libraries has a jest configuration and can run testing easily for one library"

## Task Context
- Current Branch: feature/TASK_INT_010-adapter-pattern-standardization
- Related Task: TASK_INT_012 (adapter pattern testing blocked by Jest issues)
- Core Issue: Jest configuration missing or incorrect across Nx libraries
- Scope: All libraries in the monorepo need proper Jest testing setup

## Key Requirements from User
1. Systematically fix Jest configuration issues across all Nx libraries
2. Ensure every library can run tests easily
3. Make testing infrastructure solid for library development
4. Use senior-tester agent to implement the fixes properly

## Current Problem
- Testing phase of TASK_INT_012 blocked by Jest configuration issues
- Some libraries missing Jest configuration entirely
- Inconsistent Jest setup across libraries prevents reliable testing
- Cannot validate adapter pattern implementation without proper test infrastructure

## Success Criteria
- All Nx libraries have proper Jest configuration
- `npx nx test <library-name>` works for every library
- Consistent testing patterns across the monorepo
- Testing infrastructure ready for adapter pattern validation
