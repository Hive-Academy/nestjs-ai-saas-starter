# Phase 2 Task Requirements - TASK_FE_002

## User's Request

**Original Request**: "continue with second phase please" (continuing "3D Spatial Interface Mode - Agent Constellation Implementation")
**Core Need**: Enhance the completed Phase 1 3D agent constellation with advanced spatial navigation and interaction capabilities for intuitive user control and agent selection.

## Phase 1 Foundation Status

**âœ… COMPLETED** - 3D Agent Constellation Foundation (5 days)
- Agent 3D visualization with distinct geometries and real-time state effects
- Constellation layout engine with hierarchical positioning and collision avoidance  
- Real-time agent state visualization via WebSocket integration
- Basic spatial arrangement with smooth animations and performance optimization

**Built Components Available**:
- `Agent3DComponent` - Complete 3D agent visualization with state effects
- `AgentVisualizerService` - Collection management with real-time updates
- `ConstellationLayoutService` - Intelligent positioning and dynamic repositioning
- Foundation Three.js integration with performance monitoring

## Phase 2 Requirements Analysis

### Requirement 1: Advanced Camera Controls and Navigation

**User Story**: As a user exploring the agent constellation, I want sophisticated 3D navigation controls that let me orbit, zoom, and focus on different areas smoothly, so that I can efficiently navigate to and interact with specific agents in the constellation.

**Acceptance Criteria**:

- WHEN using mouse controls THEN camera orbits smoothly around constellation center with momentum
- WHEN scrolling THEN zoom level adjusts with smooth animation and appropriate min/max limits
- WHEN double-clicking agents THEN camera focuses on that agent with cinematic transition
- WHEN using keyboard shortcuts THEN WASD/arrow keys provide precise navigation for power users
- WHEN using touch devices THEN pinch-to-zoom and pan gestures work intuitively
- WHEN constellation updates THEN camera maintains contextual focus without jarring position resets

### Requirement 2: Agent Selection and Interaction Enhancement

**User Story**: As a user working with multiple agents, I want to click on agents to select them and see detailed information about their capabilities, so that I can easily switch between agents and understand their current status and available functions.

**Acceptance Criteria**:

- WHEN hovering over agents THEN tooltips display agent capabilities, current status, and recent activity
- WHEN clicking agents THEN they become selected with clear visual highlighting
- WHEN agent is selected THEN detailed information panel shows agent-specific controls
- WHEN switching between agents THEN smooth transitions maintain visual continuity
- WHEN agents are busy THEN interaction states clearly indicate availability vs. processing

## Implementation Scope

**Phase 2 Focus Areas** (3-4 days):

1. **Spatial Navigation Service** (2 days)
   - Advanced camera controls with momentum and easing
   - Keyboard navigation shortcuts for power users
   - Touch/mobile optimization for tablet usage
   - Agent focus transitions with cinematic camera movement

2. **Agent Interaction Enhancement** (1-2 days)
   - Enhanced raycasting for precise agent selection
   - Rich tooltip system with agent capability information
   - Selection highlighting with visual feedback
   - Integration with chat interface for seamless agent switching

**Core Components to Build**:

- `SpatialNavigationService` - Advanced camera control logic
- `AgentInteractionService` - Selection and tooltip management  
- `AgentTooltipComponent` - Rich information display
- `NavigationControlsComponent` - UI overlay for navigation hints

**Technical Implementation Details**:

- Enhanced OrbitControls with custom momentum and easing
- Raycasting optimization for smooth agent selection
- Tooltip positioning system that follows 3D world coordinates
- Camera focus system with smooth interpolation to agent positions
- Touch gesture recognition for mobile/tablet support
- Integration with existing agent state management

**Timeline Estimate**: 3-4 days for Phase 2 spatial navigation and interaction
**Complexity**: Medium - builds on solid Phase 1 foundation with established patterns

## Success Metrics

**Navigation Experience**:

- Users can intuitively navigate 3D space with mouse, keyboard, and touch
- Camera movements feel smooth and responsive without lag
- Agent focus transitions provide clear spatial orientation
- Navigation controls work consistently across devices

**Interaction Quality**:

- Agent selection is precise and visually clear
- Tooltips provide valuable agent information without cluttering interface
- Transition between agents maintains conversation context
- Visual feedback clearly communicates agent availability and status

**Performance Standards**:

- Navigation maintains 60fps during camera movements
- Agent selection response time under 50ms
- Tooltip rendering does not impact 3D performance
- Touch controls work smoothly on tablet devices

## Dependencies & Constraints

**Phase 1 Foundation Required**:

- Completed Agent3DComponent with state visualization
- Working ConstellationLayoutService with agent positioning
- Established Three.js integration and performance monitoring
- AgentVisualizerService with real-time WebSocket updates

**Technical Dependencies**:

- Three.js OrbitControls for enhanced camera movement
- Existing agent communication patterns from Phase 1
- Angular 20 standalone component architecture
- WebSocket real-time agent state updates

**Integration Points**:

- Must integrate with existing chat interface for agent switching
- Must maintain performance standards from Phase 1
- Must work within 5-interface-mode system from TASK_FE_001
- Must support mobile/tablet usage patterns

## Technical Constraints

**Performance Requirements**:

- Camera movements must maintain 60fps rendering
- Agent selection must not impact constellation performance  
- Tooltip system must be lightweight and efficient
- Touch controls must be responsive on mobile devices

**Browser Compatibility**:

- WebGL support required for 3D navigation
- Touch event support for mobile/tablet optimization
- Pointer event handling for precise agent selection
- Smooth animations across different device capabilities

## Next Agent Decision

**Recommendation**: software-architect

**Rationale**: Phase 2 builds directly on the completed Phase 1 foundation with clear technical requirements. The software-architect should handle this implementation because:

1. **Solid Foundation Available** - Phase 1 provides complete 3D constellation with established patterns
2. **Clear Enhancement Scope** - Specific navigation and interaction improvements with defined acceptance criteria
3. **Established Architecture** - Three.js integration, agent services, and component patterns already proven
4. **Implementation Focus** - Primary need is enhancing existing functionality rather than research or new architecture

**Key Context for Next Agent**:

- Build on completed Agent3DComponent and ConstellationLayoutService from Phase 1
- Enhance existing camera controls with advanced navigation features
- Integrate with established agent communication and state management patterns
- Focus on user experience improvements for spatial navigation and agent interaction
- Maintain performance standards established in Phase 1 (60fps, stable memory)

**Implementation Priority**:

1. Enhanced camera controls and navigation (SpatialNavigationService)
2. Agent selection and tooltip system (AgentInteractionService)
3. Touch/mobile optimization for broader device support
4. Integration testing with existing chat interface
5. Performance validation and optimization

**Files to Modify**:

- `spatial-interface.component.ts` - integrate new navigation and interaction services
- `agent-visualizer.service.ts` - enhance with selection state management

**Files to Create**:

- `spatial-navigation.service.ts` - advanced camera control logic
- `agent-interaction.service.ts` - selection and tooltip management
- `agent-tooltip.component.ts` - rich agent information display
- `navigation-controls.component.ts` - UI overlay for navigation hints
