# Task Requirements - TASK_FE_002

## User's Request

**Original Request**: "3D Spatial Interface Mode - Agent Constellation Implementation"
**Core Need**: Implement a sophisticated 3D spatial interface that visualizes AI agents as an interactive constellation, enabling users to navigate and interact with multi-agent systems in immersive 3D space.

## Requirements Analysis

### Requirement 1: 3D Agent Constellation Visualization

**User Story**: As a user interacting with the DevBrand AI system, I want to see AI agents arranged in a 3D constellation where each agent has spatial presence and visual identity, so that I can intuitively understand agent relationships and select agents for interaction.

**Acceptance Criteria**:

- WHEN viewing the 3D interface THEN agents appear as distinct 3D objects in spatial constellation formation
- WHEN agents are active THEN their visual state reflects current activity level and type
- WHEN hovering over agents THEN tooltips display agent capabilities and current status
- WHEN clicking on agents THEN they become the active conversation partner with smooth transition
- WHEN agents coordinate THEN visual connections show data flow and communication patterns

### Requirement 2: Spatial Navigation and Interaction

**User Story**: As a user exploring the agent constellation, I want intuitive 3D navigation controls that let me orbit, zoom, and focus on different areas of the constellation, so that I can efficiently access the agents I need for my current task.

**Acceptance Criteria**:

- WHEN using mouse/touch controls THEN camera smoothly orbits around the constellation center
- WHEN scrolling THEN zoom level adjusts smoothly with appropriate limits
- WHEN double-clicking agents THEN camera focuses on that agent with cinematic transition
- WHEN using keyboard shortcuts THEN navigation responds to WASD/arrow keys for power users
- WHEN constellation updates THEN camera maintains contextual focus rather than jarring resets

### Requirement 3: Agent State and Memory Visualization

**User Story**: As a developer monitoring agent behavior, I want to see real-time visual feedback about each agent's current state, memory access, and tool usage, so that I understand what the system is doing and can debug issues effectively.

**Acceptance Criteria**:

- WHEN agents access memory THEN visual indicators show memory retrieval activity
- WHEN agents use tools THEN progress rings or particles show tool execution
- WHEN agents communicate THEN data streams visualize information exchange
- WHEN agents are idle THEN they display in low-energy state with subtle animations
- WHEN errors occur THEN visual alerts highlight problematic agents without disrupting flow

### Requirement 4: Performance-Optimized 3D Rendering

**User Story**: As a user running the interface on various devices, I want the 3D constellation to render smoothly without lag or excessive resource usage, so that the immersive experience enhances rather than hinders my productivity.

**Acceptance Criteria**:

- WHEN rendering the constellation THEN frame rate maintains 60fps on target hardware
- WHEN multiple agents are active THEN performance remains stable with level-of-detail optimization
- WHEN switching between 2D and 3D modes THEN transitions are smooth and resource-efficient
- WHEN running on lower-end devices THEN automatic quality scaling maintains usability
- WHEN memory usage grows THEN garbage collection prevents memory leaks during extended sessions

## Implementation Scope

**Primary Focus Areas**:

1. **Three.js Integration** - Build robust 3D scene with agent constellation layout
2. **Agent Visualization** - Create distinct 3D representations for different agent types
3. **Spatial Interaction** - Implement intuitive camera controls and agent selection
4. **Real-time Updates** - Connect 3D visuals to live agent state via WebSocket
5. **Performance Optimization** - Ensure smooth rendering across target devices

**Core Components to Build**:

- `ConstellationSceneComponent` - Main 3D scene container
- `Agent3DComponent` - Individual agent visualization
- `SpatialNavigationService` - Camera control and movement logic
- `AgentStateVisualizer` - Real-time state representation
- `ConstellationLayoutEngine` - Agent positioning and arrangement algorithm
- `Performance3DService` - LOD and optimization management

**Technical Implementation Details**:

- Three.js scene with orbital camera controls
- Agent meshes with custom shaders for state visualization
- Raycasting for mouse interaction and selection
- WebSocket integration for real-time state updates
- Instance rendering for performance optimization
- Smooth transitions using GSAP animation library

**Timeline Estimate**: 3-4 weeks for complete 3D spatial interface
**Complexity**: Medium-High - requires advanced 3D graphics with real-time data integration

## Success Metrics

**User Experience Validation**:

- Users can intuitively navigate the 3D space without training
- Agent selection and interaction feels natural and responsive
- Visual feedback clearly communicates agent states and activities
- Performance remains smooth during typical usage scenarios

**Technical Performance**:

- Consistent 60fps rendering on target hardware specifications
- Memory usage remains stable during extended sessions
- Agent state updates display within 100ms of backend changes
- Smooth transitions between 2D and 3D interface modes

**Functional Requirements**:

- All agent types properly represented with distinct visual identities
- Real-time agent coordination clearly visible through connection visualizations
- Tool execution and memory access provide meaningful visual feedback
- Constellation layout automatically adjusts for different numbers of agents

## Dependencies & Constraints

**Technical Dependencies**:

- Completed TASK_FE_001 foundation (Angular 20, Three.js, WebSocket integration)
- Three.js r158+ for optimal performance features
- WebSocket connection to backend agent coordination system
- GSAP for smooth animation transitions
- NgRx SignalStore for state management integration

**Foundation Requirements**:

- Must integrate with existing Angular 20 standalone component architecture
- Must work within the 5-interface-mode system from TASK_FE_001
- Must maintain performance standards established in foundation
- Must follow existing WebSocket communication patterns

**Technical Constraints**:

- Browser WebGL support required for 3D rendering
- Mobile/tablet optimization for touch-based navigation
- Memory management for scenes with many active agents
- Graceful degradation for devices with limited GPU capabilities

## Next Agent Decision

**Recommendation**: software-architect

**Rationale**: This task has clear technical requirements and builds directly on the completed TASK_FE_001 foundation. The software-architect should handle this implementation because:

1. **Clear Technical Approach** - Three.js integration patterns are well-established from foundation research
2. **Defined Requirements** - Specific 3D visualization requirements with measurable acceptance criteria
3. **Foundation Available** - Angular 20 setup, WebSocket integration, and basic Three.js framework already completed
4. **Implementation Focus** - Primary need is building the specific 3D constellation features rather than research

**Key Context for Next Agent**:

- Build on existing Three.js foundation from TASK_FE_001
- Integrate with established WebSocket patterns for real-time agent state
- Focus on performance optimization for constellation with multiple agents
- Implement within existing 5-interface-mode framework
- Prioritize intuitive spatial navigation and agent interaction patterns

**Implementation Priority**:

1. Core 3D scene setup and agent visualization
2. Spatial navigation and camera controls  
3. Real-time agent state integration
4. Performance optimization and testing
5. Integration with broader interface mode system
