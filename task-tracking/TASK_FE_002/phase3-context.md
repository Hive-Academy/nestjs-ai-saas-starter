# TASK_FE_002 Phase 3: Mock API Implementation

## User Request Evolution
Restructure phases to implement Mock API before real-time visualization:
- **Original Phase 3**: Real-time State Visualization → **New Phase 4**  
- **New Phase 3**: Mock API Implementation for Backend Simulation

## Phase 1 & 2 Completion Status
✅ **Phase 1: 3D Agent Constellation Foundation** - COMPLETED
✅ **Phase 2: Spatial Navigation and Interaction** - COMPLETED

## New Phase 3 Scope (2-3 days)
**Focus**: Mock API Implementation for Backend Simulation

### Strategic Rationale
- Backend libraries have integration issues preventing real API functionality
- Frontend 3D interface is ready for API integration but blocked
- Mock API enables unblocked development while backend issues are resolved
- Phase 4 (Real-time visualization) requires realistic backend data to be meaningful

### Core Requirements
1. **WebSocket Mock Server** (1 day)
   - Agent state simulation with realistic timing
   - Real-time communication patterns matching existing interfaces
   - Multi-agent coordination simulation

2. **Agent Behavior Simulation** (1 day)
   - Memory access simulation (ChromaDB/Neo4j query patterns)
   - Tool execution flows with progress tracking
   - Agent communication and coordination patterns

3. **Integration & Configuration** (0.5 days)
   - Environment switching between mock and real API
   - Service injection patterns for seamless swapping
   - Development tooling and debugging setup

## Foundation Available
- **Phase 1 & 2**: Complete 3D interface with navigation and interaction
- **Interface Contracts**: TypeScript interfaces and service abstractions ready
- **WebSocket Architecture**: AgentCommunicationService ready for mock integration
- **State Management**: NgRx SignalStore for agent coordination

## Success Criteria
- Realistic agent behavior simulation enabling meaningful Phase 4 development
- Environment-based API switching (mock vs real)
- Complete backend activity simulation for 3D visualization testing
- Seamless integration path when real API becomes available
