# Task Requirements - TASK_FE_002 Phase 3: Mock API Implementation

## User's Request

**Original Request**: "lets include it as phase 3 and shift phase 3 to phase 4 and then orchestrate it"
**Core Need**: Implement Mock API as new Phase 3 to unblock frontend development while backend integration issues are resolved

**Context**: The user wants to restructure the phase plan to insert Mock API implementation before real-time visualization, enabling continued development progress while backend library integration issues are addressed.

## Requirements Analysis

### Requirement 1: WebSocket Mock Server Implementation

**User Story**: As a frontend developer working on the 3D agent constellation, I want a realistic mock server that simulates agent state changes and communication patterns, so that I can develop and test the real-time visualization features without being blocked by backend issues.

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- WHEN connecting to mock WebSocket server THEN it provides realistic agent state updates with proper timing intervals
- WHEN agents simulate activity THEN state changes follow realistic patterns (idle → thinking → executing → idle)
- WHEN multiple agents coordinate THEN mock server simulates communication flows between agents
- WHEN tool execution occurs THEN mock progress updates with realistic timing and completion states
- WHEN memory operations happen THEN mock ChromaDB/Neo4j query simulation with appropriate delays

### Requirement 2: Agent Behavior Simulation Engine

**User Story**: As a developer testing the 3D interface, I want the mock API to generate realistic agent behaviors including memory access, tool usage, and inter-agent communication, so that the visualization accurately represents what will happen with the real backend.

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- WHEN agents access memory THEN mock simulates ChromaDB vector searches and Neo4j graph queries with realistic response times
- WHEN agents use tools THEN mock provides progress tracking with incremental updates and final results
- WHEN agents communicate THEN mock simulates message passing, coordination, and state synchronization
- WHEN agent workflows execute THEN mock follows realistic multi-step execution patterns with proper error scenarios
- WHEN system load varies THEN mock adjusts response times to simulate real-world performance characteristics

### Requirement 3: Service Integration and Configuration

**User Story**: As a developer working on the system, I want seamless switching between mock and real API endpoints through environment configuration, so that the transition to real backend services requires minimal code changes.

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- WHEN environment is set to mock mode THEN all services use mock implementations without code changes
- WHEN environment switches to production THEN real API services are injected seamlessly
- WHEN debugging mock behavior THEN development tools provide insight into mock state and timing
- WHEN mock data needs customization THEN configuration allows scenario-based testing
- WHEN integration testing occurs THEN mock matches real API interfaces exactly

## Implementation Scope

**Primary Focus Areas**:

1. **WebSocket Mock Server** - Node.js/Express server providing realistic agent communication simulation
2. **Agent State Simulation** - Complex state machines mimicking real agent behavior patterns
3. **API Interface Matching** - Exact TypeScript interface compliance for seamless real API swapping
4. **Development Tooling** - Configuration and debugging tools for mock scenarios
5. **Integration Testing** - Validation that mock behavior matches expected real API patterns

**Core Components to Build**:

- `MockWebSocketServer` - Standalone server for agent state simulation
- `AgentBehaviorSimulator` - Engine for realistic agent activity patterns
- `MockAgentCommunicationService` - Drop-in replacement for real service
- `MockEnvironmentConfig` - Environment-based service injection configuration
- `MockScenarioManager` - Predefined scenarios for testing different system states
- `MockDataGenerator` - Realistic data generation for memory operations and tool results

**Technical Implementation Details**:

- Express.js WebSocket server with realistic timing patterns
- State machines for agent behavior simulation (idle → active → executing → completed)
- Mock data generators for ChromaDB vectors and Neo4j graph responses
- Service injection patterns using Angular's DI system for environment switching
- Development debugging interface for mock state visualization
- Configuration-driven scenario testing with predefined agent interaction patterns

**Timeline Estimate**: 2-3 days for complete Mock API implementation
**Complexity**: Medium - requires realistic behavior simulation while maintaining interface compliance

## Success Metrics

**Development Unblocking Validation**:
- 3D agent constellation can connect to mock API and display realistic agent state changes
- Frontend development can proceed with meaningful testing scenarios
- Phase 4 real-time visualization can be developed and tested against mock backend
- Integration with real API requires only environment configuration changes

**Mock Realism Standards**:
- Agent state transitions follow realistic timing patterns (2-10 seconds per state)
- Memory operations simulate appropriate query delays (100-500ms for vectors, 50-200ms for graph)
- Tool execution provides incremental progress updates with realistic completion times
- Multi-agent coordination scenarios demonstrate complex interaction patterns

**Integration Quality**:
- TypeScript interfaces match exactly between mock and real implementations
- Service injection patterns enable zero-code-change environment switching
- Mock scenarios cover all critical user interaction patterns from Phase 1 & 2
- Error scenarios and edge cases properly simulated for robust testing

## Dependencies & Constraints

**Foundation Requirements**:
- **Phase 1 & 2 COMPLETED**: 3D Agent Constellation Foundation with spatial navigation ready for API integration
- **Existing TypeScript Interfaces**: `AgentState`, `AgentCommunication`, `ToolExecution` interfaces from TASK_FE_001
- **WebSocket Architecture**: `AgentCommunicationService` ready for mock implementation injection
- **State Management**: NgRx SignalStore integration for mock data consumption

**Technical Dependencies**:
- Node.js/Express for standalone mock server implementation
- WebSocket library compatibility with existing Angular client
- TypeScript strict type checking for interface compliance
- Angular DI system for service injection and environment configuration

**Integration Constraints**:
- Must maintain exact API contract compliance for seamless real backend transition
- Mock timing must be realistic enough to validate 3D visualization performance
- Development tooling must not interfere with production build process
- Mock scenarios must cover sufficient complexity for meaningful Phase 4 development

## Phase Restructuring Impact

**Original Phase 3 → New Phase 4**: Real-time State Visualization
- **Rationale**: Real-time visualization requires realistic backend data to be meaningful
- **Benefit**: Phase 4 can now develop against rich mock data rather than static test data
- **Timeline**: Phase 4 timeline unchanged, but development quality significantly improved

**New Phase 3 Value**:
- **Immediate Unblocking**: Frontend development continues while backend issues are resolved
- **Enhanced Phase 4**: Rich mock data enables more sophisticated real-time visualization testing
- **Risk Mitigation**: Parallel development reduces critical path dependencies

## Next Agent Decision

**Recommendation**: software-architect

**Rationale**: Mock API implementation requires architectural decisions about service abstraction patterns, realistic behavior simulation, and environment configuration strategies. The software-architect should handle this because:

1. **Service Architecture Design** - Need to design proper abstraction layers for mock/real API switching
2. **Behavior Simulation Engine** - Complex state machine design for realistic agent behavior patterns
3. **Integration Patterns** - Establish clean patterns for environment-based service injection
4. **Foundation Integration** - Must work seamlessly with existing Phase 1 & 2 implementation

**Key Context for Next Agent**:
- **Foundation Available**: Complete 3D interface from Phase 1 & 2 ready for API integration
- **Interface Contracts**: Existing TypeScript interfaces must be matched exactly by mock implementation
- **Development Priority**: Unblock Phase 4 development while maintaining real API transition path
- **Realism Requirements**: Mock behavior must be sophisticated enough for meaningful 3D visualization testing
- **Timeline Constraint**: 2-3 days for complete implementation to maintain overall project schedule

**Implementation Priority**:
1. WebSocket mock server with basic agent state simulation
2. Realistic agent behavior patterns and timing
3. Service injection configuration for environment switching
4. Development tooling and scenario management
5. Integration testing and Phase 4 preparation
