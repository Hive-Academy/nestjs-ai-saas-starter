# TASK_FE_002 Phase 2: Spatial Navigation and Interaction

## User Request Continuation
Continue with second phase of "3D Spatial Interface Mode - Agent Constellation Implementation"

## Phase 1 Completion Status
âœ… **3D Agent Constellation Foundation (5 days)** - COMPLETED
- Agent 3D visualization components with distinct geometries
- Constellation layout engine with intelligent positioning
- Real-time agent state visualization
- Basic spatial arrangement with collision avoidance

## Phase 2 Scope (3-4 days)
**Focus**: Spatial Navigation and Interaction

### Task 2.1: Camera Controls and Navigation (2 days)
- Mouse orbit controls around constellation center
- Smooth zoom with appropriate limits
- Double-click agent focus with cinematic camera transition
- Keyboard shortcuts for power users (WASD navigation)
- Touch controls for tablet/mobile optimization

### Task 2.2: Agent Selection and Interaction (1-2 days)  
- Raycasting for precise agent selection on mouse hover/click
- Tooltips displaying agent capabilities and current status
- Agent selection highlighting with visual feedback
- Smooth transitions when switching active agents
- Integration with existing chat interface for agent conversation switching

## Foundation Available
- Completed Phase 1 implementation
- Angular 20 + Three.js integration service
- WebSocket real-time communication architecture
- NgRx SignalStore for multi-agent state coordination
- Existing constellation visualization with agent positioning

## Success Criteria
- Users can navigate 3D space intuitively with orbit, zoom, and focus controls
- Agent selection and interaction feels natural and responsive
- Smooth transitions and professional user experience
