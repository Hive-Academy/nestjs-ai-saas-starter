- [x] Smooth transitions when switching between selected agents
- [x] Integration with existing chat interface for seamless agent conversation switching
- [x] Tooltip positioning system that follows 3D world coordinates but renders in screen space

**Files**:
- [x] Create: `D:\projects\nestjs-ai-saas-starter\apps\dev-brand-ui\src\app\features\spatial-interface\services\agent-interaction.service.ts`
- [x] Create: `D:\projects\nestjs-ai-saas-starter\apps\dev-brand-ui\src\app\features\spatial-interface\components\agent-tooltip.component.ts`
- [x] Modify: `D:\projects\nestjs-ai-saas-starter\apps\dev-brand-ui\src\app\features\spatial-interface\spatial-interface.component.ts`

**Implementation Summary**:
- Complete AgentInteractionService with performance-optimized raycasting and double-click detection
- Professional AgentTooltipComponent with rich agent information display and responsive design
