**Priority**: HIGH (Essential user experience requirement)
**Timeline**: 1-2 days
**Files to Modify**:
- `D:\projects\nestjs-ai-saas-starter\apps\dev-brand-ui\src\app\features\spatial-interface\services\agent-visualizer.service.ts`

**Files to Create**:
- `D:\projects\nestjs-ai-saas-starter\apps\dev-brand-ui\src\app\features\spatial-interface\services\agent-interaction.service.ts`
- `D:\projects\nestjs-ai-saas-starter\apps\dev-brand-ui\src\app\features\spatial-interface\components\agent-tooltip.component.ts`

**Expected Outcome**: Rich agent interaction with contextual information and seamless chat integration
**Developer Assignment**: frontend-developer

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- [ ] Enhanced raycasting for precise agent selection with performance optimization
- [ ] Rich tooltips displaying agent capabilities, current status, and recent activity
- [ ] Agent selection highlighting with distinct visual feedback (glow, outline, or size changes)
- [ ] Smooth transitions when switching between selected agents
- [ ] Integration with existing chat interface for seamless agent conversation switching
- [ ] Tooltip positioning system that follows 3D world coordinates but renders in screen space

## Future Work Moved to Registry
