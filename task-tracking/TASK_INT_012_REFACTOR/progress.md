## üìù Key Decisions & Changes

### [2025-08-27 12:30] - Phase 1 Completion Report

**Context**: Completed adapter relocation from library to application layer
**Implementation**: Successfully moved ChromaVectorAdapter and Neo4jGraphAdapter to application
**Technical Details**:

- Updated imports to use @hive-academy/nestjs-memory library interfaces
- Maintained self-contained adapter pattern with direct database client connections
- Preserved all validation methods and error handling from base classes
- Created clean export structure in application adapters directory
  **Files Created**:
- /apps/dev-brand-api/src/app/adapters/index.ts
- /apps/dev-brand-api/src/app/adapters/memory/chroma-vector.adapter.ts
- /apps/dev-brand-api/src/app/adapters/memory/neo4j-graph.adapter.ts
  **Impact**: Library architectural violation resolved - adapters no longer coupled to database implementations in library
  **Next**: Ready for Phase 2 - Provider Configuration

### [CURRENT] - Architectural Strategy Decision

**Context**: Need to maintain 100% backward compatibility during adapter pattern refactoring
**Decision**: Use phased approach with provider injection pattern maintaining existing database configurations
**Impact**: Zero breaking changes, smooth migration path for applications  
**Rationale**: Requirement 1.1-5.5 mandate library independence while preserving functionality

### [CURRENT] - File Movement Strategy Decision

**Context**: Adapters need relocation from library to application without breaking interfaces
**Decision**: Move concrete implementations only, preserve all interface and type exports in library
**Impact**: Library becomes database-agnostic while maintaining contract definitions for consumers
**Rationale**: Requirements 2.1-2.2 specify adapter relocation, Requirements 4.1-4.2 mandate interface preservation
