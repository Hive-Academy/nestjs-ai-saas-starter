# Requirements Document - TASK_INT_012_REFACTOR

## Introduction

The user has identified a critical architectural violation in the current adapter pattern implementation. The adapters (ChromaVectorAdapter and Neo4jGraphAdapter) are currently embedded within the library (@libs/langgraph-modules/memory) when they should exist in the consumer application code (@apps/dev-brand-api). This violates the fundamental principles of the adapter pattern and creates inappropriate coupling between the library and specific database implementations.

## Business Context

**Current Architectural Problem**:

- Adapters are tightly coupled to the library rather than being consumer-specific implementations
- This prevents the library from being truly database-agnostic
- Violates the Dependency Inversion Principle by forcing the library to depend on concrete implementations
- Makes it impossible for different applications to use different database strategies
- Creates maintenance burden by putting implementation-specific logic in the library

**Business Value of Refactoring**:

- **True Library Independence**: The memory library becomes completely database-agnostic
- **Consumer Flexibility**: Each application can implement adapters that match their infrastructure
- **Proper Separation of Concerns**: Library handles business logic, applications handle data persistence
- **Scalable Architecture**: Multiple applications can use the same library with different backends
- **Maintenance Excellence**: Library development is isolated from database-specific concerns
- **Enterprise Compliance**: Follows established enterprise architecture patterns

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Library Decoupling

**User Story:** As a library maintainer, I want the memory library to be completely database-agnostic, so that it can be reused across applications with different infrastructure choices.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the memory library is built THEN it SHALL NOT contain any database-specific adapter implementations
2. WHEN interfaces are defined THEN they SHALL exist in the library for contract enforcement
3. WHEN the library is imported THEN it SHALL require consumers to provide adapter implementations
4. WHEN no adapters are provided THEN the library SHALL provide clear error messages guiding implementation
5. WHEN the library operates THEN it SHALL only interact through interface contracts, never concrete implementations

### Requirement 2: Consumer-Side Adapter Implementation

**User Story:** As an application developer, I want to implement database adapters within my application code, so that I have full control over persistence strategies and can optimize for my specific infrastructure.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN adapters are moved THEN ChromaVectorAdapter SHALL be relocated to @apps/dev-brand-api/src/app/adapters/
2. WHEN adapters are moved THEN Neo4jGraphAdapter SHALL be relocated to @apps/dev-brand-api/src/app/adapters/
3. WHEN adapters are implemented THEN they SHALL be injected as providers in the application's module configuration
4. WHEN configuration occurs THEN adapters SHALL be provided as vectorStore and graphStore providers
5. WHEN multiple applications exist THEN each SHALL implement its own adapter strategies independently

### Requirement 3: Provider Injection Architecture

**User Story:** As an application architect, I want to inject storage adapters as providers in my application module, so that I can leverage NestJS dependency injection for clean architecture.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN configuring the memory module THEN it SHALL accept vectorStore provider token
2. WHEN configuring the memory module THEN it SHALL accept graphStore provider token
3. WHEN providers are configured THEN they SHALL be resolved through NestJS dependency injection
4. WHEN adapters are injected THEN they SHALL implement the required interface contracts
5. WHEN runtime validation occurs THEN provider compliance SHALL be verified during module initialization

### Requirement 4: Interface Contract Preservation

**User Story:** As a developer working with adapters, I want interface contracts to remain in the library, so that I understand the required implementation contract while keeping implementations consumer-specific.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN interfaces are maintained THEN IVectorService SHALL remain in the library's public API
2. WHEN interfaces are maintained THEN IGraphService SHALL remain in the library's public API
3. WHEN adapters are implemented THEN they SHALL inherit from base service classes in the library
4. WHEN runtime type checking occurs THEN adapter compliance SHALL be automatically validated
5. WHEN errors occur THEN meaningful messages SHALL guide developers to correct implementation issues

### Requirement 5: Configuration Pattern Standardization

**User Story:** As a developer using multiple applications with the same library, I want a consistent pattern for providing custom adapters, so that I can apply the same architectural approach across different projects.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN memory module is configured THEN it SHALL accept an adapters configuration object
2. WHEN adapters configuration is provided THEN it SHALL support { vectorStore: Provider, graphStore: Provider } format
3. WHEN providers are specified THEN they SHALL be class references that implement the required interfaces
4. WHEN configuration validation occurs THEN clear error messages SHALL guide proper provider setup
5. WHEN examples are provided THEN they SHALL demonstrate the complete provider injection pattern

## Non-Functional Requirements

## Expected Deliverables

1. **Application-Side Adapters**: ChromaVectorAdapter and Neo4jGraphAdapter relocated to @apps/dev-brand-api/src/app/adapters/
2. **Provider Configuration**: Updated app.module.ts with proper adapter provider injection
3. **Library Cleanup**: Memory library with adapters removed and database dependencies eliminated
4. **Interface Validation**: Runtime checks ensuring adapter implementations comply with contracts

6. **Working Examples**: Demonstration of alternative adapter implementation (e.g., in-memory for testing)
7. **Verification Tests**: Test suite confirming library independence and functionality preservation

## Migration Example

The refactored configuration should follow this pattern:

```typescript
// @apps/dev-brand-api/src/app/adapters/chroma-vector.adapter.ts
// (Moved from library to application)

// @apps/dev-brand-api/src/app/adapters/neo4j-graph.adapter.ts
// (Moved from library to application)

// @apps/dev-brand-api/src/app/app.module.ts
MemoryModule.forRoot({
  ...getMemoryConfig(),
  adapters: {
    vectorStore: ChromaVectorAdapter, // Application-provided adapter
    graphStore: Neo4jGraphAdapter, // Application-provided adapter
  },
});
```

This ensures the library remains database-agnostic while giving applications full control over their persistence strategies.
