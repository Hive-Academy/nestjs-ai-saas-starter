# TASK_INT_011 Context

## Original User Request

User Request: i would like you to evaluate the nestjs-langgraph library and analyze its utilization (despite the fact that you will find some redudnant and maybe unused code ) lets make a new workfow to analyze all of these issues and analyze the pros and cons of changing how we provide the child modules and load everything inside that module rather we have a each child module be injected and utilized separately from that module, and if we did that would we still need this library ? as we might just extract the memory module from it and convert it to a child module and then it will be a pure orchestrations where we buckle up all child modules ( where we do have a separate package for each one of them ) please analyze te ocde very carefully and make sure you understand how it works and how we consume it @apps\dev-brand-api\src\app\config\nestjs-langgraph.config.ts

## Task Context
- Current Branch: feature/TASK_INT_010-adapter-pattern-standardization
- Previous Task: TASK_INT_010 (adapter pattern standardization)
- This is an architectural evaluation and strategic analysis task
- Requires deep understanding of current nestjs-langgraph library architecture
- Focus on module loading strategies and library necessity evaluation

## Key Analysis Areas
1. Current module loading and child module injection patterns
2. Code utilization analysis (redundant/unused code identification)
3. Architectural evaluation: centralized vs distributed module loading
4. Library necessity assessment if modules become standalone
5. Memory module extraction feasibility
6. Pure orchestration architecture evaluation
