# Task Description - TASK_INT_004

## 🎯 Strategic Overview

**Business Value**: Implementing a comprehensive monitoring module is critical for production-ready AI workflows, enabling proactive issue detection, SLA compliance, performance optimization, and operational excellence. This module will provide the observability foundation needed for enterprise-grade deployment.

**User Impact**: Development teams will gain real-time visibility into AI workflow performance, enabling faster troubleshooting and proactive optimization. Operations teams will have robust alerting and health monitoring for production systems.

**Technical Debt Addressed**: Currently the monitoring module is a skeleton implementation with only basic event-based metrics collection. This creates significant operational blindness and prevents production deployment with confidence.

## 📊 Success Metrics

- **Performance**: Metrics collection with <100ms overhead per workflow execution
- **Quality**: 10/10 code quality score, zero 'any' types, full TypeScript safety
- **Observability**: Complete workflow visibility with metrics, alerts, health checks, and dashboards
- **Production Readiness**: Integration with Prometheus, Grafana, and enterprise monitoring backends

- **Scalability**: Handle 10,000+ metrics per minute without degradation
- **Reliability**: 99.9% uptime for monitoring services themselves
- **Security**: Secure handling of sensitive metrics data with proper sanitization
- **Maintainability**: Each service <200 lines, clear separation of concerns

## ✅ Acceptance Criteria (BDD Format)

```gherkin
Feature: Monitoring Module Implementation
  As a DevOps engineer
  I want comprehensive monitoring for AI workflows
  So that I can ensure production system reliability and performance

  Scenario: AC1 - Complete SOLID Architecture
    Given the monitoring module exists
    When I examine the service structure
    Then I should see exactly 6 focused services following SOLID principles
    And each service should be under 200 lines of code
    And all services should have proper TypeScript interfaces
    And no service should use 'any' types

  Scenario: AC2 - Metrics Collection Integration
    Given a workflow is executing
    When the workflow completes successfully
    Then metrics should be collected for duration, success, and resource usage
    And metrics should be available via MetricsCollectorService
    And metrics should be exportable to Prometheus format

  Scenario: AC3 - Alerting System Functionality
    Given alert rules are configured
    When a workflow exceeds performance thresholds
    Then an alert should be triggered within 30 seconds
    And the alert should be sent to configured channels
    And alert cooldowns should prevent spam

  Scenario: AC4 - Health Check System
    Given the system is running
    When health checks are performed
    Then all dependent services should be monitored
    And health status should be aggregated and available
    And unhealthy dependencies should trigger alerts

  Scenario: AC5 - Performance Tracking
    Given workflows are executing
    When performance data is collected
    Then baselines should be established for comparison
    And performance anomalies should be detected
    And performance trends should be tracked over time

  Scenario: AC6 - Dashboard Data Availability
    Given monitoring is active
    When dashboard data is requested
    Then real-time metrics should be available
    And historical data should be accessible
    And data should be properly formatted for visualization
```

## 🚨 Risk Analysis Matrix

| Risk | Probability | Impact | Mitigation Strategy |
|------|------------|--------|-------------------|

## 🔗 Dependencies & Constraints

### Technical Dependencies

- **Core NestJS**: Module system, dependency injection, decorators
- **Event Emitter**: For workflow event subscription
- **Prometheus Client**: For metrics export (if enabled)
