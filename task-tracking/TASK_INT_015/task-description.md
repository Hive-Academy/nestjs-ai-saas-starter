# Requirements Document - TASK_INT_015

## Introduction

This task addresses critical library configuration issues that completely block the NestJS AI SaaS Starter ecosystem's ability to publish libraries and support local development. Research has identified fundamental misconfigurations across 10+ publishable libraries that prevent successful builds, publications, and imports.

**Business Context**: The entire library publishing pipeline is broken due to incorrect entry points, inconsistent build configurations, and TypeScript issues. This prevents ecosystem growth, blocks developer onboarding, and creates technical debt that compounds over time.

**Value Proposition**: Systematic resolution of these configuration issues will unlock the publishing ecosystem, enable proper local development workflows, and establish consistent patterns that reduce maintenance overhead.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Fix Critical Entry Point Configurations

**User Story:** As a developer using published @hive-academy libraries, I want all entry points to correctly reference the built distribution files, so that I can successfully import and use the libraries in my applications.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN building a library THEN package.json main/module/types fields SHALL point to ./dist/ paths instead of ./src/ paths
2. WHEN publishing a library THEN the exports field SHALL correctly map to distribution files for production imports
3. WHEN developing locally THEN the development export SHALL still reference source files for hot reloading
4. WHEN npm installing a published library THEN all imports SHALL resolve correctly without build errors

### Requirement 2: Standardize Build Configuration Across Libraries

**User Story:** As a maintainer of the monorepo, I want all publishable libraries to use consistent build configuration, so that build processes are predictable and maintainable.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN building any library THEN all libraries SHALL use the same @nx/rollup executor configuration
2. WHEN comparing project.json files THEN all libraries SHALL follow the same structure and options
3. WHEN adding a new library THEN developers SHALL have a clear template to follow
4. WHEN troubleshooting builds THEN consistent patterns SHALL reduce debugging time

### Requirement 3: Resolve TypeScript Configuration Issues

**User Story:** As a developer working in the monorepo, I want TypeScript compilation to work correctly across all libraries, so that I can develop efficiently without build errors.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN TypeScript compiles THEN composite configuration issues SHALL be resolved
2. WHEN building libraries THEN all tsconfig.lib.json files SHALL follow consistent patterns
3. WHEN using IDE features THEN TypeScript language server SHALL work correctly
4. WHEN importing between libraries THEN path mapping SHALL resolve correctly

### Requirement 4: Validate Complete Build and Publish Pipeline

**User Story:** As a library maintainer, I want to verify that all libraries build and can be published successfully, so that the ecosystem is ready for distribution.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN running `nx run-many -t build` THEN all libraries SHALL build successfully without errors
2. WHEN running `npm publish --dry-run` THEN all libraries SHALL pass validation checks
3. WHEN testing local imports THEN libraries SHALL work correctly in demo applications
4. WHEN checking package contents THEN only necessary files SHALL be included in publications

- **Consistency**: 100% of publishable libraries SHALL follow identical configuration patterns
