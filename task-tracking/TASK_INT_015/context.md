Branch: feature/TASK_INT_015-library-configuration-standardization

## Context

This task addresses critical library configuration issues discovered during TASK_INT_014 research:

1. **WRONG ENTRY POINTS**: All package.json files point to ./src/index.js instead of ./dist/index.js
2. **INCONSISTENT CONFIGURATION**: Mixed approaches between libraries
3. **BROKEN BUILD/PUBLISH PIPELINE**: Libraries cannot be published or used locally
4. **TYPESCRIPT CONFIG ISSUES**: Incomplete composite setup
