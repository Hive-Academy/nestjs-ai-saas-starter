# Requirements Document - TASK_INT_012

## Introduction
The user has requested architectural refactoring of the `@libs/langgraph-modules/nestjs-memory` module to eliminate tight coupling with specific database implementations (ChromaDB and Neo4j). This initiative will transform the current directly-injected dependencies into a flexible adapter pattern, enabling extensibility, easier testing, and improved architectural decoupling while maintaining all existing functionality.

## Business Context
**Current Problem**: The memory module creates tight coupling by directly injecting `ChromaDBService` and `Neo4jService`, making it impossible to:
- Use alternative vector or graph database implementations
- Test components in isolation without full database dependencies
- Extend functionality with custom storage adapters
- Follow SOLID principles (Dependency Inversion Principle violation)

**Business Value**: This refactoring enables:
- **Extensibility**: Users can implement custom storage adapters
- **Testability**: Easier mocking and unit testing
- **Flexibility**: Support for multiple database backends
- **Future-proofing**: Architecture supports new storage technologies
- **Cleaner Architecture**: Follows enterprise patterns and SOLID principles

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Interface Contract Definition
**User Story:** As a developer using the memory module, I want well-defined interface contracts for vector and graph services, so that I can understand the expected behavior and potentially implement custom adapters.

#### Acceptance Criteria
1. WHEN interfaces are defined THEN vector service interface SHALL include all current ChromaDB operations (store, retrieve, search, delete)
2. WHEN interfaces are defined THEN graph service interface SHALL include all current Neo4j operations (track, relationships, stats, connections)
3. WHEN interfaces are created THEN they SHALL be exported from the module's public API
4. WHEN interfaces are defined THEN they SHALL support both synchronous and asynchronous operations
5. WHEN error conditions occur THEN interface methods SHALL define clear error handling contracts

### Requirement 2: Adapter Implementation
**User Story:** As a developer, I want concrete adapters for ChromaDB and Neo4j that implement the interface contracts, so that existing functionality is preserved while enabling the new architecture.

#### Acceptance Criteria
1. WHEN ChromaDB adapter is implemented THEN it SHALL implement the vector service interface completely
2. WHEN Neo4j adapter is implemented THEN it SHALL implement the graph service interface completely
3. WHEN adapters are created THEN they SHALL maintain 100% backward compatibility with existing functionality
4. WHEN adapters handle errors THEN they SHALL wrap and standardize error responses
5. WHEN adapters are instantiated THEN they SHALL accept their respective database service via dependency injection

### Requirement 3: Module Registration Enhancement
**User Story:** As an application developer, I want to inject custom adapters when registering the memory module in my app.module.ts, so that I can use alternative storage implementations or custom logic.

#### Acceptance Criteria
1. WHEN module registration occurs THEN users SHALL be able to provide custom vector service adapters
2. WHEN module registration occurs THEN users SHALL be able to provide custom graph service adapters
3. WHEN no custom adapters are provided THEN default ChromaDB and Neo4j adapters SHALL be used automatically
4. WHEN custom adapters are provided THEN module SHALL validate they implement required interfaces
5. WHEN module configuration fails THEN clear error messages SHALL guide users to correct configuration

### Requirement 4: Extensibility Framework
**User Story:** As a third-party developer, I want to create custom adapters that integrate seamlessly with the memory module, so that I can implement specialized storage strategies for my use case.

#### Acceptance Criteria
1. WHEN creating custom adapters THEN developers SHALL only need to implement the interface contracts
2. WHEN custom adapters are registered THEN they SHALL work seamlessly with existing memory services
3. WHEN documentation is provided THEN it SHALL include adapter development guidelines and examples
4. WHEN adapter validation occurs THEN runtime checks SHALL ensure interface compliance
5. WHEN multiple adapters are available THEN configuration SHALL support adapter selection strategies

## Non-Functional Requirements

### Performance Requirements
- **Response Time**: Adapter overhead SHALL add < 1ms to existing operations
- **Memory Usage**: New architecture SHALL not increase memory footprint by more than 5%
- **Throughput**: Maintain 100% of current operation throughput through adapters

### Security Requirements
- **Interface Validation**: Runtime validation prevents malicious adapter injection
- **Error Handling**: Adapters SHALL not leak sensitive configuration details in errors
- **Access Control**: Adapter interfaces SHALL not bypass existing security mechanisms

### Maintainability Requirements
- **Code Structure**: Clear separation between interfaces, adapters, and business logic
- **Documentation**: Comprehensive adapter development guide with examples
- **Testing**: Each adapter SHALL have dedicated test suites with > 90% coverage

### Compatibility Requirements
- **Backward Compatibility**: 100% API compatibility for existing memory module users
- **Migration Path**: Existing imports and usage patterns SHALL continue to work without changes
- **Database Support**: Current ChromaDB and Neo4j functionality SHALL be fully preserved
